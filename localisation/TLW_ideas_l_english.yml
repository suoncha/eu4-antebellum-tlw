 #Visigothic ideas

 VSG_ideas_bonus:0 "Visigothic Ambition"
 vsg_first:0 "The Reconquista"
 vsg_first_desc:0 "Those blasted Andalusians have oppressed our fellow Christians long enough! Brave countrymen, free your brothers and sisters, tortured, in shackles, by the evil Sultan for centuries. Their chains will hold the righteous light of God no longer! All heathens will burn in His light! ¡Vamonos!"
 vsg_second:0 "Gothic Romanization"
 vsg_second_desc:0 "Our ancestors, from a bunch of Germanic brutes, have quickly adapted the Romans administration and their technological advancements. This has been heightened even more with many unknown knowledges coming from the East by the Muslim, which created the modern Visigothic people that easily adapt to changes."
 vsg_third:0 "Gothic Kingdoms"
 vsg_third_desc:0 "The Goths were a widespread ethnic group, streching from Hispania in the West to Crimea in the East. As we have taken the mantle of Visigoths, it is obvious that may lay claims to everywhere our ancestors have stepped foot on."
 vsg_fourth:0 "Visigothic Armada"
 vsg_fourth_desc:0 "The Angelcynn navy is a joke, the Frankish navy is a joke - they act tough, but crumble at the smallest problem. The Visigothic Armada dominates every sea and ocean in the entire of Europe."
 vsg_fifth:0 "Roman Engineering"
 vsg_fifth_desc:0 "Many buildings of ancient Rome are still being put to good use in Hispania, thanks to their remarkable engineering skills which we have learned a part from it to maintain and keep them functional. Their capabilities even surpass those of the Franks and Germans engineers, thus guarantee our production supremacy in the West."
 vsg_sixth:0 "Legacy of Rome"
 vsg_sixth_desc:0 "Not the Empire of the Greeks in the East, not the pretender joke orchestrated by the Germans and Franks, not the Rurikovichs in the land of Rus or even the delusional Welshs in Britain, it is only us - the Visigoths - are the true heirs of Rome, and only us will be able to restore the once lost Empire of the Romans."
 vsg_seventh:0 "Tercios Visigothic"
 vsg_seventh_desc:0 "The Visigothic Tercio is an administrative unit nominally composed of up to 3,000 soldiers subdivided into 10 compañías, composed of pikemen and arquebusiers or musketeers. These companies are deployed in battle and are further subdivided into units of 30 soldiers. These smaller units can be deployed individually or brought together to form "Visigothic squares". This allows our armies to be highly flexible and easily managed - just what we need when controlling an empire as large as ours."
