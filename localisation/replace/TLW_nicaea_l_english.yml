 ab_nicaea.5.t:0 "Ptolemaic Restoration"
 ab_nicaea.5.d:0 "Since the last time Greeks ruled over the sands of Egypt in the 1st century before the Christ, much has changed. The Ptolemaios were once the Kings of Aegyptos, accumulated immeasurable wealth by being the crossroad between Asia, Europe and Africa. But those things had long gone. Former temples lay in ruins, and the mighty pyramids themselves have lost their limestone shine, for the Romans, and later Arabs, have ruled these lands for centuries, until now. Ruling over an Egypt whose populace is now completely foreign to us will be difficult beyond measure. Luckily, the children of Ptolemy is up to the task. This land would thrive again under them."
 ab_nicaea.5.a:0 "At last, Egypt is returned to Greek hands"
 ab_nicaea.7.t:0 "Rebirth of Hellenism - Religion"
 ab_nicaea.7.d:0 "There is also a problem that need to be directed: Christianity. Indeed, while we have been the children of Christ for over a thousand years, our said religion was brought upon by Rome. After all, wasn't it Rome that wiped out the Hellenic temples and replaced them with churches and cathedrals? Many suggest that we should bring back the Hellenic pantheon of old.\n\nIn that case, another choice can be considered for the Greek people - Islam. It's true that we have been in countless wars againts the Muslim in the past, but the reason was largely from their rivalry with the Roman Christianity. Now that we are free from the Roman control, we can adopt Shia Islam as our new national religion. The core values of Shia perfectly match with our warrior-state society. Furthermore, the Muslim in the Levant would also see us as their rightful rulers, should we conquer them.\n\nThe clique is very insignificant and struggles to gain support with even the most radical anti Roman parts of society, yet a single word from our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could change all that - we could give them the resources and authority to conduct such a reform of Greek faith. It might be extremely destabilizing and costly, but at the end of the day, our redemption from Rome is surely a priceless goal."
 ab_nicaea.7.a:0 "Do you really consider eternal damnation to be worth all of this?"
 ab_nicaea.7.b:0 "We will embrace the Hellenic pantheon!"
 ab_nicaea.7.c:0 "Europa shall see the light of Allah!"
