#Event
 ab_nicaea.5.t: "Ptolemaic Restoration"
 ab_nicaea.5.d: "Since the days when the Greeks last held sway over the sands of Egypt in the 1st century BC, much has changed. The Ptolemies, once the esteemed rulers of Aegyptos, amassed vast wealth by controlling the crossroads between Asia, Europe, and Africa. However, those glory days have long faded. Temples lie in ruin, and the majestic pyramids have lost their luster of limestone, as centuries of Roman and Arab rule have reshaped these lands.\n\nNow, ruling over an Egypt whose populace entirely stray from the Hellenic roots presents a daunting challenge. Fortunately, the descendants of Ptolemy are up to the task. Under their guidance, this land shall thrive once more."
 ab_nicaea.5.a: "At last, Egypt is returned to Greek hands"

 ab_nicaea.7.t: "Rebirth of Hellenism - Religion"
 ab_nicaea.7.d: "In our quest for identity and sovereignty, we confront a pressing challenge: the question of Christianity, the faith imposed upon us by Rome. For centuries, we have borne the mantle of Christendom, yet it was Rome that obliterated our ancient Hellenic temples, replacing them with their churches and cathedrals. Some advocate for a return to the worship of the Hellenic pantheon, a symbol of our pre-Roman heritage.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider Islam as a path forward for the Greek people. Though our history is rife with conflict against Muslims, much of it driven by their rivalry with Roman Christianity. Adopting Shia Islam as our national religion aligns with our warrior-state ethos, and could even garner support from Muslims in the Levant should we assert our rightful rule over them.\n\nWhile the faction advocating for this change remains marginal, even among the most ardent anti-Roman elements of society, a decree from our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could elevate their cause. By granting them the necessary resources and authority, we could embark on a transformative reform of the Greek faith. Though such a move carries great risk and cost, the prospect of breaking free from Rome's influence is invaluable."
 ab_nicaea.7.a: "Do you really consider eternal damnation to be worth all of this?"
 ab_nicaea.7.b: "We will embrace the Hellenic pantheon"
 ab_nicaea.7.c: "The world shall see the light of Allah!"
