 ab_rus.6.d: "Briefly after our own migration westwards, the Slavs splintered into the many denominations we know today. But a sentiment, as of our most recent victories, is growing in the hearts of each one of us - one of national unity, one of cultural fervour, one of brotherhood. Our state, the most powerful among the children of the very first Slavs, is viewed as the harbinger of a new era, one in which Slavs may live prosper and potent under our hegemony. The Third Rome, it seems, was never a Slavic one, but it was the symbol of this new movement - Pan-Slavism."
