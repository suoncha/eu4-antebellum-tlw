 ab_visigoths.0.t: "Aftermath of the Crusader"
 ab_visigoths.0.d: "The kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia stand as the last bastions of Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula, steadfast against the encroaching shadow of the Caliphate. When the heathens first swept into Visigothic lands, many attempts at resistance were futile. Yet, from the courage of Pelagius and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias arose. Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria, expanded the realm to encompass both Galicia and Asturias, but dynastic disputes later divided them. Navarra's bid for independence, led by Inigo Arista, saw success against Carolingian invaders and Muslim overlords, leading to the rise of the Jimenez Dynasty.\n\nIn 1443, Iberia suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles fell, and northern lands were scorched by Christian raiding parties. A hasty peace between the Franks and Umayyads only temporarily halted the threat of famine and renewed offensive on the frontline. Yet, for the Iberian crusaders, this peace felt like betrayal, shaking their faith and casting uncertainty on the future of the peninsula."

From [227.GetName] to [213.GetName], a call for this union resonates. Some advocate for a new path, venturing westward for fortune and securing Christ's legacy in the unknown lands. Others long to reclaim our Visigothic roots in the east, aspiring to restore the glory of the fallen Western Empire of Rome."
