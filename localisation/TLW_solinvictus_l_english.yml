 vsg_first: "The Reconquista"
 vsg_first_desc: "Those accursed Andalusians have oppressed our fellow Christians for far too long! Brave countrymen, liberate your brothers and sisters, tortured and shackled by the evil Sultan for centuries. Their chains shall no longer dim the righteous light of God! All heathens shall perish in His divine wrath! ¡Vamonos!"
 vsg_second: "Hispanic Romanization"
 vsg_second_desc: "Our ancestors, once a mere horde of Germanic brutes, swiftly assimilated Roman administration and technological advancements. This integration was further enriched by the influx of knowledge from the East via the Muslims, culminating in the emergence of the modern Visigothic people, adept at embracing change."
 vsg_third: "From West to East"
 vsg_third_desc: "The Goths were a widespread ethnic group, spanning from Hispania in the West to Crimea in the East. As heirs to the Roman legacy, it is clear that we may lay claim to every land where our ancestors once trod."
 vsg_fourth: "Hispanic Armada"
 vsg_fourth_desc: "The Angelcynn navy is laughable, the Frankish navy is laughable - they boast, yet falter at the slightest challenge. The Hispanic Armada reigns supreme over every sea and ocean throughout Europe."
 vsg_fifth: "Roman Engineering"
 vsg_fifth_desc: "Numerous buildings from ancient Rome continue to serve essential functions in Hispania, a testament to their remarkable engineering prowess.

This ensures our unrivaled production supremacy in the West."
 vsg_sixth: "Legacy of Rome"
 vsg_sixth_desc: "Amidst the claims and aspirations of empires across Europe, from the East to the West, there stands one unwavering truth: it is the Regnum Hispaniae who embody the rightful heirs of Rome's legacy. Amidst the shadows of Greek dominion, German and Frankish jests, and the aspirations of Rurikovichs in Rus, it is only us who possess the conviction and capability to restore the once-great Empire of the Romans."
 vsg_seventh: "Tercios Hispanic"
 vsg_seventh_desc: "The Hispanic Tercio stands as a formidable administrative unit, boasting up to 3,000 soldiers divided into 10 compañías. Each company comprises pikemen and arquebusiers or musketeers, allowing for versatile deployment on the battlefield. Further subdivided into units of 30 soldiers, these smaller formations can be deployed individually or assembled into formidable 'Hispanic squares,' ensuring our armies remain agile and easily coordinated across our vast empire."

 ab_visigoths.0.t: "Aftermath of the Crusader"
 ab_visigoths.0.d: "The kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia stand as the last bastions of Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula, steadfast against the encroaching shadow of the Caliphate. When the heathens first swept into Visigothic lands, many attempts at resistance were futile. Yet, from the courage of Pelagius and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias arose. Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria, expanded the realm to encompass both Galicia and Asturias, but dynastic disputes later divided them. Navarra's bid for independence, led by Inigo Arista, saw success against Carolingian invaders and Muslim overlords, leading to the rise of the Jimenez Dynasty.\n\nIn 1443, Iberia suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles fell, and northern lands were scorched by Christian raiding parties. A hasty peace between the Franks and Umayyads only temporarily halted the threat of famine and renewed offensive on the frontline. Yet, for the Iberian crusaders, this peace felt like betrayal, shaking their faith and casting uncertainty on the future of the peninsula."
 ab_visigoths.0.a: "The Christians of Iberia must unite against the Caliphate!"

 ab_visigoths.1.t: "Crown of Hispania, United"
 ab_visigoths.1.d: "In the shadow of Rome's fallen arches, a new sun rises over Hispania. From the emerald coasts of Galicia, where Suebi warriors once defied empires, to the unyielding mountains of Navarra, home of the Vascone spirit, and the ancient heartlands of Asturias, steeped in Hispano-Roman glory, the Iberians have forged a singular realm. The echoes of Tarraco's forums, where Trajan was born, and Toledo's halls, where Leovigild dreamed of unity, resound in this triumph. United under the banner of Regnum Hispaniae, we stand at the precipice of destiny. Shall we cast aside the chains of history to forge a bold new future, extending the Reconquista across the seas, carrying our blades beyond al-Andalus to distant shores and embracing our sacred duty as a Crusader kingdom, crowned as Iberia, the bulwark of Christendom? Or shall we turn eastward, reviving the Roman legacy of our forefathers, reclaiming the Eternal City and its eastern kin with the might of Iberian knights? The annals of history await our decree, as the ghosts of emperors and kings watch in silent vigil."
 ab_visigoths.1.a: "Forge the New Hispania, unbound by history!"
 ab_visigoths.1.b: "We will reclaim the legacy of Rome!"
 VSG_RENAME_SUEBI: "Country changes to §YSuebi§!."
 VSG_RENAME_VASCONIA: "Country changes to §YVasconia§!."

 ab_visigoths.2.t: "Iberian Reconquista"
 ab_visigoths.2.d: "Our Iberian brethren have launched a Reconquista to expel the Muslims from Hispania. With our support, their success seems inevitable."
 ab_visigoths.2.a: "Mobilize the army! We shall aid our fellow Christians in their righteous cause"
 ab_visigoths.2.b: "This matter does not concerns us"

 ab_visigoths.3.t: "Frankish Support"
 ab_visigoths.3.d: "The Emperor pledges support in our Reconquista against Andalusia. With their help, we shall free Iberia from Islamic tyranny!"
 ab_visigoths.3.a: "For Christianity!"

 ab_visigoths.5.t: "Glory of Hispania"
 ab_visigoths.5.d: "From the sun-scorched plains of Hispania, where Tarraco's arches and Emerita's theaters once proclaimed Rome's might, we have forged a path to glory. Our people, heirs to the Hispano-Romans who birthed emperors and philosophers, have reclaimed the mantle of the Eternal Empire. In our veins flows the blood of Trajan's legions and the resolve of Alaric's warriors, united under the cross and the eagle. As Rome's ancient forums resound with Iberian hymns, we stand as custodians of a reborn empire, its foundations laid in the marble of Hispania's past. Shall we crown this triumph, forging a Rome that shines anew with the spirit of our forefathers?"
 ab_visigoths.5.a: "For Hispania and Rome, Eternal!"

 ab_visigoths.6.t: "True Faith of Hispania"
 ab_visigoths.6.d1: "As we march toward the Eternal City, our banners aloft under the unconquered sun, a divine question grips Hispania's soul. In Italy, the Mad Duke Robert XI has embraced Sol Invictus, blending the ancient Zunist worship of the Sun God with Christ's sacred light, reviving Emperor Aurelian's vision to unify a fractured empire. In the shadow of ancient Roman ruins, our scholars uncover scrolls echoing this belief, proclaiming it the true heir to Rome's spiritual legacy. Yet voices whisper of Constantinople's Orthodox rites, whose golden domes beckon us to join the Eastern Church, binding us to Byzantium's Roman lineage. Others, steadfast in their Catholic vows, urge us to uphold the faith that carried us through centuries of Andalusian shadow. Shall we crown Sol Invictus as our guiding star, embrace the Eastern Church to forge a new Rome, or remain true to the cross that has sustained Hispania's heart?"
 ab_visigoths.6.d2: "Our quest to reclaim Rome stirs the soul of Hispania, where the legacy of Trajan and Leovigild burns bright. Yet, as we tread this sacred path, Capua's Mad Duke Robert XI has spurned the Zunist scholars, casting doubt on its promise to revive Aurelian's unifying faith. In our own lands, where Emerita's temples and Corduba's ruins speak of Rome's grandeur, some still call for Sol Invictus, blending sun and cross to forge a new imperial creed. Others turn their gaze to Constantinople, urging us to adopt the Orthodox faith of the Eastern Empire, whose Roman heritage aligns with our own. But the Catholic Church, our bulwark against al-Andalus, demands unwavering loyalty. Shall we defy Capua's rejection and embrace Sol Invictus, join the Eastern Church to unite Rome's halves, or hold fast to the Catholic flame that defines us?"
 ab_visigoths.6.a: "Crown Sol Invictus, Light of a New Rome"
 ab_visigoths.6.b: "Embrace the Eastern Church, Heirs of Byzantium"
 ab_visigoths.6.c: "Remain Catholic, the faith of our forefathers"

 ab_visigoths.7.t: "La Judería"
 ab_visigoths.7.d: "In the heart of [225.GetName], where the Guadalquivir weaves its silver threads through a city of minarets and markets, the Jewish quarter stands as a testament to al-Andalus' radiant past. Here, under the Umayyad banners, a vibrant community has flourished for centuries, its scholars and merchants weaving a tapestry of wisdom and wealth that rivals the great academies of the East. In the shadow of the ancient synagogue, where prayers rise to the heavens, men like Hasdai ibn Shaprut: physician, diplomat, and sage - once counseled Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, their words shaping the destiny of a golden age. Scrolls of astronomy, medicine, and philosophy, penned in Hebrew and Arabic, illuminate the libraries, while the souks hum with the trade of silks, spices, and secrets from distant shores. The Jews of [225.GetName], heirs to a legacy older than Roman eagle, have turned this city into a beacon of learning, their influence stretching from the Pillars of Hercules to the courts of the East. Yet, their prominence stirs whispers among our emirs, who marvel at their brilliance but guard against the envy of lesser men. As our caliphate faces the Christian swords of the north, the legacy of La Judería endures, a shining star in Andalusian crown."
 ab_visigoths.7.a: "Their presence is welcomed!"

 tlw_capua.0.t: "Visitors from the East"
 tlw_capua.0.d: "A remarkable group of scholars, fleeing turmoil in the Far East, has sought refuge at our court. These learned men follow the Zunist faith, preaching the ancient teachings of the Sun God, which strikingly mirror the revered beliefs of Rome before the advent of Christianity. Their doctrines have piqued the curiosity of Robert XI, the Mad Duke, who is now captivated by the prospect of rediscovering and integrating this forgotten wisdom.\n\nRobert's fascination grows as he explores the forbidden knowledge of these eastern scholars, seeing in it the potential to revive a powerful and unified faith. By incorporating the core tenets of Zunism with the sacred values of Christianity, he envisions the creation of Sol Invictus, a hybrid religion that could solidify our claim as the legitimate successors of Rome. This vision echoes the legacy of Emperor Aurelian, who once championed the worship of the Unconquered Sun to unify the empire. Reviving this ancient tradition and blending it with Christianity could strengthen our spiritual foundation and elevate our political stature, reaffirming our place as heirs to the great Roman legacy."
