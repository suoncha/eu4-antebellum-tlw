# North American Estate Reforms
 punic_estate_reform_church_title: "Reform Bureaucracy"
 punic_estate_reform_church_desc: "Our traditional ways of governance, though effective in times of peace, now show signs of strain as external threats grow. The arrival of the palemen has exposed the weaknesses in our administrative structure. To survive and thrive, we must reform our bureaucracy, adopting more efficient systems to ensure better control over our people and territories."

 punic_estate_reform_religion_title: "Revoke the Pact"
 punic_estate_reform_religion_desc: "The Pact of Shalim, once a symbol of religious harmony and coexistence, now binds us to an ideal that no longer serves our interests. With the palemen's influence spreading, we must pursue true religious unity within our lands. The time has come to revoke the Pact, cleansing our faith of foreign influence and ensuring that only the true believers remain."

 punic_estate_reform_nobles_title: "Policy of Aggression"
 punic_estate_reform_nobles_desc: "For too long, we have been content to live in peace, avoiding conflict wherever possible. But peace has left us vulnerable, while the palemen advance and claim lands that should be ours. The time for passivity is over. We must adopt a policy of aggression, transforming from a peaceful people into a nation of warriors. Our survival depends on our ability to fight for our future, to defend what is ours, and to take what we need."

 punic_estate_reform_burghers_title: "Outward Expansion"
 punic_estate_reform_burghers_desc: "The lands beyond our borders have long been considered wastelands, unfit for settlement. But with the palemen encroaching on every side, we can no longer afford to ignore these territories. It is time to set our sights on outward expansion, claiming these lands before others do. With the right investment, these barren lands can be transformed into new homes for our people, ensuring our continued growth and survival in a changing world."

 punic_estate_reform_horde_title: "Unleash the Horde"
 punic_estate_reform_horde_desc: "Our people have lived in isolation for generations, secure in our lands but disconnected from the world. Now, isolationism can no longer protect us. The palemen bring threats that require bold action. It is time to unleash the horde, abandoning our defensive posture for one of all-out expansion. We will sweep across the land, claiming new territories and expanding our influence to ensure our survival in this new era."

# Smuggle
 punic_smuggle_decision_title: "Smuggle Goods from the Muskogeans"
 punic_smuggle_decision_desc: "The Muskogean Crime Syndicate controls exotic goods found only in the Black Market. Though risky, working with smugglers could grant us access to these valuable items, boosting our economy and giving the League an edge in trade."
