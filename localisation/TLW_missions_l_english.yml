 byzantium_aquitania_title: "Invade Aquitania"

 byzantium_germany_title: "Conquer Germany"
 byzantium_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne.

It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 byzantium_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"

 byzantium_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"

 byzantium_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 byzantium_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower.

#Serbia
 ser_roman_ambition_title: "Roman Ambition"
 ser_roman_ambition_desc: "Reclaiming the ancient borders of the Eastern Roman Empire marks a significant milestone in our quest to revive the glory of Rome. Yet, our ambitions do not end there. We must set our sights on a grander vision - to restore the vast territories once ruled by Emperor Justinian. By doing so, we will not only revive the legitimate Rome but also usher in a new era of prosperity and power for our people."

 ser_iron_title: "Claim the Iron Crown"
 ser_iron_desc: "Northern Italia fancies itself a loose mess of independent imbeciles, deluded duchies and babbling buffoons, swimming in more undeserved wealth and squandered manpower than they know what to do with. Crushing this sad state of disunity by smothering the peninsula's remaining vestiges of power and sovereignity will signal to the world who the true masters of Italia are."

 ser_rus_union_title: "Tsar of Rus"
 ser_rus_union_desc: "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority."

 ser_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 ser_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."

 ser_jerusalem_title: "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 ser_jerusalem_desc: "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rome reborn may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."

 ser_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 ser_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 ser_muskets_title: "Westernise The Army"
 ser_muskets_desc: "The face of warfare has changed significantly. We have lagged behind our western rivals in technological advance. This cannot be ignored. We need to find an ally willing to help us catch up with their military reforms."

 ser_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 ser_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 ser_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 ser_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must booster our number to surpass any adversary."

 ser_money_title: "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 ser_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

 ser_roman_industries_title: "Roman Industries"
 ser_roman_industries_desc: "As technology advances, traditional manufacturing methods become obsolete. To maintain our status as a great power, we must embrace these innovations and modernize our production processes to outpace our rivals."

 ser_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"
 ser_roads_desc: "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits."

 ser_wonders_title: "Roman Great Wonders"
 ser_wonders_desc: "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

 ser_restored_rome_title: "Western Reconquest"
 ser_restored_rome_desc: "With the empire restored, it is our destiny to reclaim the Western Empire. As heirs to the great Roman conquests, we are obligated to revive the spirit of the ancient republic and expand our dominion across the Western lands. Let us embark on this noble endeavor and usher in a new era of Roman greatness."

 ser_mecca_title: "The Heart of Islam"
 ser_mecca_desc: "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."

 ser_arelat_title: "Arelat Conquest"
 ser_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."

 ser_iberia_title: "Triumph for Iberia"
 ser_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 ser_dethrone_title: "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 ser_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 ser_alpine_title: "March Across the Alps"
 ser_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 ser_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 ser_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."

 ser_belgica_title: "Roman Belgica"
 ser_belgica_desc: "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants. As a former province of the Roman Empire, it is clear that we hold legitimate claims to the region. By incorporating it, Belgica will thrive even more under our administration."

 ser_cultural_hegemony_title: "Cultural Hegemony"
 ser_cultural_hegemony_desc: "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image. This establishes our cultural supremacy over all nations, ensuring that the world reflects the grandeur of Rome."

 ser_fortify_rhine_title: "Fortify Rhine"
 ser_fortify_rhine_desc: "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."

 ser_germany_title: "Conquer Germany"
 ser_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 ser_restoration_title: "Imperial Restoration"
 ser_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

 ser_europe_title: "Roma Europa"
 ser_europe_desc: "The opportunity to unify Europa under Roman banners has arrived. With the mighty Dioceses by our side, all of Europe will finally be united under one single nation. The eternal peace shall be brought upon this continent for eons to come, as long as Rome endures."

 ser_odyssey_title: "The Third Odyssey"
 ser_odyssey_desc: "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 ser_newworld_base_title: "New World Base"
 ser_newworld_base_desc: "After extensive exploration to the West, we have made a startling discovery about the Punics who have managed to escape their demise by fleeing to the New World. Preparations will be done for the inevitable conflict ahead."

 ser_conquer_seas_title: "Conquer the Seas"
 ser_conquer_seas_desc: "Though arriving late to the colonization endeavor, the vastness of the seas remains unclaimed. However, this situation is set to change, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has laid claim to every corner of the globe, marking the dawn of the Roman colonialism."

 ser_punics_title: "Exterminate Punics"
 ser_punics_desc: "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them will be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god can save them this time!"

 ser_cities_byzantine_title: "Byzantine Great Cities"
 ser_cities_byzantine_desc: "The Great Cities of Byzantium were the beating hearts of the Hellenosphere, bustling hubs of economic and cultural activity, each home to hundreds of thousands. To secure a stable economy, it is imperative that we breathe new life into these once-great centers."

 ser_cities_latin_title: "Latin Metropolises"
 ser_cities_latin_desc: "To govern the Western half of our empire more efficiently, we must establish a system of Latin Metropolises. These will serve as the capital cities of the Latinsphere, acting as central hubs for both governance and the process of Romanization among the European population."

 ser_sophia_title: "Renovate Hagia Sophia"
 ser_sophia_desc: "As the head of the Orthodox Christian Church, the Hagia Sophia is a symbol of Orthodox authority and unity. We must renovate the Hagia Sophia to once again show the Orthodox and Catholic world our claim to the entirety of Christendom."

 ser_university_title: "Revive the Pandidakterion"
 ser_university_desc: "The Pandidakterion, a grand center of learning in Constantinople, has fallen into disuse over the past millenia due to wars and disasters. However, with the resurgence of our empire and a revival in cultural interests, we should revive the Pandidakterion to encourage higher education."

 ser_ministries_title: "Imperial Ministries"
 ser_ministries_desc: "The imperial bureaucracy has always been an important part in the imperial administration since ancient times. With the ever expanding borders of our empire many of the old ministries must be revived and new ones must be created. We should reform the various imperial ministries to make it more efficient."

 ser_nomos_title: "Nomos Empsychos"
 ser_nomos_desc: "Nomos Empsychos, the law animate, decrees that the Emperor and Autocrat of all Romans shall be the final judge on all things judicial. This right has been granted to his imperial majesty by God and none shall defy it."

 ser_library_title: "The Great Library"
 ser_library_desc: "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia. Unfortunately, it was destroyed multiple times by fires and barbarians who disregarded its valuable contents. It's time to rebuild this unparalleled source of knowledge."

 ser_wall_title: "Theodosian Walls"
 ser_wall_desc: "The Theodosian Walls have defended the city of Constantinople for centuries and will continue to be its primary defence during sieges for centuries to come. It is time for us to extend and renovate the wall, due to the recent growth of Constantinople."

 ser_megalopolis_title: "The Megalopolis"
 ser_megalopolis_desc: "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."

 ser_gigalopolis_title: "The Gigalopolis"
 ser_gigalopolis_desc: "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented the plan to renovate [316.GetName] into a part of our Imperial City. From now on, this area should be called the Greater Constantinople Area."

 ser_ecumenopolis_title: "The Ecumenopolis"
 ser_ecumenopolis_desc: "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area. It is us who will make this theory into a reality. The world shall recognize our Imperial City as Caput Mundi - the Head of The World."

 ser_persia_title: "Conquest of Persia"
 ser_persia_desc: "As the victor of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories. Persia, famed for its opulence and treasures, promises untold riches to those who conquer it. The bountiful wealth of Persian cities will enrich our empire immeasurably."

 ser_persosphere_title: "Persian Administration"
 ser_persosphere_desc: "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within Rome."

 ser_ariana_title: "Secure Ariana"
 ser_ariana_desc: "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 ser_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 ser_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 ser_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 ser_georgia_desc: "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

 ser_cities_persian_title: "Persian Great Cities"

 ser_invade_india_desc: "The Indus Valley stands as the pivotal gateway to Indian riches. By conquering this strategic region, we not only gain a valuable vantage point but also sever a crucial artery of Indian manpower and supplies. This campaign promises to open new avenues of opportunity and strengthen our foothold in the subcontinent."

 ser_maharajas_title: "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ser_maharajas_desc: "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 ser_tibet_title: "Conquer Tibet"
 ser_tibet_desc: "Tibet is the natural border dividing the Sinosphere from India, protecting the western flank of China. Its conquest would leave the entire subcontinent vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Rome."

 ser_burma_title: "Conquer Burma"
 ser_burma_desc: "Burma stands as the gateway to the East Indies - a vast subcontinent holding infinite wealth. Its strategic position, nestled among mountain ranges and with access to the Malayan Sea, makes it a valuable military base. This region will be the stepping stone for our conquest of Southeast Asia."

 ser_invade_china_title: "Invade China"
 ser_invade_china_desc: "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use, better be under our management.

 ser_cities_chinese_title: "Chinese Metropolises"

 ser_mongolia_title: "Subjugate the Mongols"
 ser_mongolia_desc: "The vast northern steppes of Mongolia are scattered with petty chiefdoms of the Mongols. Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."

 ser_far_east_title: "Conqueror of Far East"
 ser_far_east_desc: "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long. It is evident that we must intervene decisively to put an end to their conflict and restore peace and stability to the region. By incorporating both kingdoms under the jurisdiction of a Diocese, we can ensure a unified and harmonious administration that benefits all."

 ser_indochina_title: "Rule Indochina"
 ser_indochina_desc: "The triumph of our conquests in Asia has elevated our pride and glory to unprecedented heights. To sustain this momentum, we must seek new conquests. Indochina beckons, its lands ripe for submission to Rome. Let us extend our dominion and usher its citizens into our fold."

 ser_east_indies_title: "Dominate South East Asia"
 ser_east_indies_desc: "The allure of the East Indies is undeniable, with its exotic spices coveted by all within our empire. By subjugating the East Indies, we shall ensure a steady and exclusive supply of the spices, bringing new flavors and experiences to every corner of our realm."

 ser_asia_title: "Roma Asia"
 ser_asia_desc: "Rome's greatness has long been undisputed, yet its identity as a purely European empire has often been questioned in comparison to the grand Asian empires of old. However, this debate will soon be put to rest as we stand on the brink of a historic achievement. With our imminent conquest of Asia, Rome will transcend its European origins and rightfully claim its place among the legendary empires of antiquity."

 ab_russia_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 ab_russia_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."

 ab_russia_jerusalem_title: "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 ab_russia_jerusalem_desc: "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rome reborn may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."

 ab_russia_heal_schism_title: "Mend the Schism"
 ab_russia_heal_schism_desc: "A petty dispute in old days long past shattered the Kingdom of God in two halves - that of the Catholic West and the Orthodox East, or so they are referred to. If we were to elevate the restored pentarchy to a height and honour undeniable to the Catholic West, the truly pious and faithful shall flock to the gates of not only our empire, but His rightful church - that which dwells in Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and the heart of every holy preacher in Europe who knows our glory."

 ab_russia_caesaropapism_desc: "Caesaropapism, a political system merging state and church authority under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has emerged. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wields unparalleled control over both secular and religious domains, ensuring the welfare of Christian subjects. This consolidation grants absolute dominion over ecclesiastical matters, thus firmly establishing authority over the Church."

 ab_russia_megalopolis_title: "The Megalopolis"
 ab_russia_megalopolis_desc: "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 ab_russia_gigalopolis_title: "The Gigalopolis"
 ab_russia_gigalopolis_desc: "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen.

 ab_russia_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 ab_russia_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 ab_russia_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 ab_russia_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 ab_russia_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 ab_russia_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must booster our number to surpass any adversary."

 ab_russia_money_title: "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 ab_russia_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

 ab_russia_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"
 ab_russia_roads_desc: "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits."

 ab_russia_wonders_title: "Roman Great Wonders"
 ab_russia_wonders_desc: "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

Let us embark on this noble endeavor and usher in a new era of Roman greatness."

 ab_russia_mecca_title: "The Heart of Islam"
 ab_russia_mecca_desc: "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."

 ab_russia_arelat_title: "Arelat Conquest"
 ab_russia_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."

 ab_russia_iberia_title: "Triumph for Iberia"
 ab_russia_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 ab_russia_dethrone_title: "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 ab_russia_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 ab_russia_alpine_title: "March Across the Alps"
 ab_russia_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 ab_russia_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 ab_russia_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."

 ab_russia_belgica_title: "Roman Belgica"
 ab_russia_belgica_desc: "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants. As a former province of the Roman Empire, it is clear that we hold legitimate claims to the region. By incorporating it, Belgica will thrive even more under our administration."

 ab_russia_cultural_hegemony_title: "Cultural Hegemony"
 ab_russia_cultural_hegemony_desc: "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image. This establishes our cultural supremacy over all nations, ensuring that the world reflects the grandeur of Rome."

 ab_russia_fortify_rhine_title: "Fortify Rhine"
 ab_russia_fortify_rhine_desc: "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."

 ab_russia_germany_title: "Conquer Germany"
 ab_russia_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 ab_russia_restoration_title: "Recover Britannia"
 ab_russia_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

 ab_russia_odyssey_title: "The Third Odyssey"
 ab_russia_odyssey_desc: "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 ab_russia_newworld_base_title: "New World Base"
 ab_russia_newworld_base_desc: "After extensive exploration to the West, we have made a startling discovery about the Punics who have managed to escape their demise by fleeing to the New World. Preparations will be done for the inevitable conflict ahead."

 ab_russia_conquer_seas_title: "Conquer the Seas"
 ab_russia_conquer_seas_desc: "Though arriving late to the colonization endeavor, the vastness of the seas remains unclaimed. However, this situation is set to change, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has laid claim to every corner of the globe, marking the dawn of the Roman colonialism."

 ab_russia_punics_title: "Exterminate Punics"
 ab_russia_punics_desc: "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them will be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god can save them this time!"

 ab_russia_persosphere_title: "Persian Administration"
 ab_russia_persosphere_desc: "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within Rome."

 ab_russia_ariana_title: "Secure Ariana"
 ab_russia_ariana_desc: "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 ab_russia_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 ab_russia_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 ab_russia_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 ab_russia_georgia_desc: "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

Today, no formidable rival stands to oppose us in taking this region for ourselves."

 ab_russia_cities_persian_title: "Persian Great Cities"
 ab_russia_cities_persian_desc: "The Great Cities of Persia are the beating hearts of the political, economic, and cultural realms in the Persosphere.

 ab_russia_invade_india_desc: "The Indus Valley stands as the pivotal gateway to Indian riches.

This campaign promises to open new avenues of opportunity and strengthen our foothold in the subcontinent."

 ab_russia_maharajas_title: "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ab_russia_maharajas_desc: "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 ab_russia_tibet_title: "Conquer Tibet"
 ab_russia_tibet_desc: "Tibet is the natural border dividing the Sinosphere from India, protecting the western flank of China. Its conquest would leave the entire subcontinent vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Rome."

 ab_russia_burma_desc: "Burma stands as the gateway to the East Indies - a vast subcontinent holding infinite wealth.

Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."

 ab_russia_far_east_title: "Conqueror of Far East"
 ab_russia_far_east_desc: "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long. It is evident that we must intervene decisively to put an end to their conflict and restore peace and stability to the region. By incorporating both kingdoms under the jurisdiction of a Diocese, we can ensure a unified and harmonious administration that benefits all."

 ab_russia_indochina_title: "Rule Indochina"
 ab_russia_indochina_desc: "The triumph of our conquests in Asia has elevated our pride and glory to unprecedented heights. To sustain this momentum, we must seek new conquests.

 rum_christian_march_rome_desc: "'The Eternal City'. 'Caput Mundi'. 'City of God'. Rome has had many a name. As we march to take back the city, however, there are but four words that echo in the mind of every true son of Rome. 'Nostra Civitas'. Our city. 'Cor Nostrum'. Our heart."

 rum_christian_jerusalem_title: "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 rum_christian_jerusalem_desc: "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rûm may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."

 rum_christian_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 rum_christian_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."

 rum_christian_mecca_title: "The Heart of Islam"
 rum_christian_mecca_desc: "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."

 rum_christian_rus_union_title: "Tsar of Rus"
 rum_christian_rus_union_desc: "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority."

 rum_christian_iron_title: "Claim the Iron Crown"
 rum_christian_iron_desc: "Northern Italia fancies itself a loose mess of independent imbeciles, deluded duchies and babbling buffoons, swimming in more undeserved wealth and squandered manpower than they know what to do with.

 rum_christian_roman_ambition_desc: "Reclaiming the ancient borders of the Eastern Roman Empire marks a significant milestone in our quest to revive the glory of Rome.

By doing so, we will not only revive the legitimate Rome but also usher in a new era of prosperity and power for our people."

 rum_christian_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 rum_christian_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 rum_christian_muskets_title: "Westernise The Army"

 rum_christian_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 rum_christian_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 rum_christian_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 rum_christian_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must booster our number to surpass any adversary."

 rum_christian_money_title: "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 rum_christian_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

 rum_christian_wonders_title: "Roman Great Wonders"
 rum_christian_wonders_desc: "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

 rum_christian_restored_rome_title: "Western Reconquest"
 rum_christian_restored_rome_desc: "With the empire restored, it is our destiny to reclaim the Western Empire.

 rum_christian_arelat_title: "Arelat Conquest"
 rum_christian_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."

 rum_christian_iberia_title: "Triumph for Iberia"
 rum_christian_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 rum_christian_dethrone_title: "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 rum_christian_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 rum_christian_alpine_title: "March Across the Alps"
 rum_christian_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 rum_christian_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 rum_christian_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."

 rum_christian_belgica_title: "Roman Belgica"
 rum_christian_belgica_desc: "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants.

 rum_christian_cultural_hegemony_title: "Cultural Hegemony"
 rum_christian_cultural_hegemony_desc: "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image. This establishes our cultural supremacy over all nations, ensuring that the world reflects the grandeur of Rome."

 rum_christian_fortify_rhine_title: "Fortify Rhine"
 rum_christian_fortify_rhine_desc: "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."

 rum_christian_germany_title: "Conquer Germany"
 rum_christian_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 rum_christian_restoration_title: "Imperial Restoration"
 rum_christian_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions.

Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 rum_christian_caesaropapism_title: "Caesaropapism"
 rum_christian_caesaropapism_desc: "Caesaropapism, a political system merging state and church authority under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has emerged. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wields unparalleled control over both secular and religious domains, ensuring the welfare of Christian subjects. This consolidation grants absolute dominion over ecclesiastical matters, thus firmly establishing authority over the Church."

 rum_christian_nomos_title: "Nomos Empsychos"

 rum_christian_megalopolis_title: "The Megalopolis"
 rum_christian_megalopolis_desc: "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."

 rum_christian_gigalopolis_title: "The Gigalopolis"
 rum_christian_gigalopolis_desc: "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented the plan to renovate [316.GetName] into a part of our Imperial City.

 rum_christian_ecumenopolis_title: "The Ecumenopolis"
 rum_christian_ecumenopolis_desc: "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area.

 rum_christian_ariana_title: "Secure Ariana"
 rum_christian_ariana_desc: "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies.

 rum_christian_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 rum_christian_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order.

 rum_christian_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 rum_christian_georgia_desc: "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

 rum_christian_maharajas_desc: "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority.

 rum_christian_tibet_title: "Conquer Tibet"

 lat_italy_title: "Rule Italy"

 lat_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 lat_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever.

 lat_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne.

It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 lat_far_east_title: "Conqueror of Far East"
 lat_far_east_desc: "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long.

 wls_barbary_title: "Control Maghreb"
 wls_barbary_desc: "The Berber pirates have ravaged peaceful and idyllic Christian shorelines across the Mediterranean for far too long. If we were to control the coastline, we could put an end to their sea raids once and for all. The entire continent of Europe would undoubtedly reap the benefits of secure and peaceful maritime trade."

 wls_second_rome_title: "The Second Rome"
 wls_second_rome_desc: "The seat of Eastern Orthodoxy has long been a rival to our own power and legitimacy as Catholics. Now that we control the Patriarchate of the East, we shall reclaim this seat of authority and spread our faith across the Eastern lands."

 wls_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 wls_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 wls_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 wls_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 wls_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 wls_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents.

 wls_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century.

 wls_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"

With the ever expanding borders of our empire many of the old ministries must be revived and new ones must be created. We should reform the various imperial ministries to make it more efficient."

 wls_roman_law_title: "Reform the Roman Law"
 wls_roman_law_desc: "Roman law is the main legal civil judicial codex of the Roman Empire. However, it is an antiquated ruleset and modern problems surely require modern solutions. Therefore we shall reform the Roman law to make it suit the needs of our modern empire."

 wls_nomos_title: "Nomos Empsychos"

 wls_library_title: "The Great Library"
 wls_library_desc: "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia.

 wls_persia_desc: "As the victor of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories. Persia, famed for its opulence and treasures, promises untold riches to those who conquer it. The bountiful wealth of Persian cities will enrich our empire immeasurably."

 wls_persosphere_title: "Persian Administration"
 wls_persosphere_desc: "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within Rome."

 wls_ariana_title: "Secure Ariana"
 wls_ariana_desc: "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies.

 wls_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 wls_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower.

 wls_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 wls_georgia_desc: "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

 wls_maharajas_title: "Defeat the Maharajas"
 wls_maharajas_desc: "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 wls_tibet_title: "Conquer Tibet"
 wls_tibet_desc: "Tibet is the natural border dividing the Sinosphere from India, protecting the western flank of China. Its conquest would leave the entire subcontinent vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Rome."

 vsg_fortify_rhine_desc: "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."

 nicene_reform_hellenic_title: "Hellenic Reformation"
 nicene_reform_hellenic_desc: "As the wave of the Reformation sweeps across the Christian world, threatening to divide their faith further, we must be wary of its potential impact on our own borders. The Greek population, deeply rooted in Orthodoxy, may be susceptible to similar religious divergence. To prevent this, we must undertake a reformation of the Hellenic faith, uniting the children of Hellas under a single religious banner."

 nicene_women_of_greece_title: "Women of Hellas"
 nicene_women_of_greece_desc: "Throughout ancient history, women have held significant positions in Greek society, with figures like Queen Gorgo of Sparta standing as powerful examples.

 nicene_orthodoxy_title: "Hellenic Orthodoxy"
 nicene_orthodoxy_desc: "After centuries of enduring the Roman yoke, the first sparks of a new Orthodox faith under true Greek cultural leadership have finally begun to emerge. We must nurture these sparks and fuel their growth. The Church of Orthodoxy shall be purified and cleansed of Roman influence, replaced by the Greek identity."

 nicene_christianity_leader_title: "Protector of Christendom"

 nicene_islamic_court_title: "Court of Elites"
 nicene_islamic_court_desc: "Within the Muslim world, the inner court of nobles and advisors holds immense influence, boasting expertise in human and theological knowledge.

 nicene_hellenic_islamization_title: "Hellenic Islamization"
 nicene_hellenic_islamization_desc: "The Hellenization of our esteemed nation must coincide with Islamization. This dual process is marked by distinct challenges: firstly, a significant portion of our populace adheres to Orthodoxy, necessitating their contentment while fostering their conversion to the path of Allah. Secondly, our conquest targets, Anatolia and the Levant, harbor a Muslim population aligned with the erroneous sect. Only Shia Islam holds the truth!"

 nicene_golden_age_islam_title: "Rekindle the Golden Age"
 nicene_golden_age_islam_desc: "The illustrious era of Islam's Golden Age waned with the onslaught of the Crusaders and the Mongols. Yet, as these formidable adversaries diminish and stability and prosperity flourish in the region, the prospect of reigniting this golden epoch beckons to the entire Ummah."

 nicene_serbia_title: "Serbian Conquest"
 nicene_serbia_desc: "To advance deeper into Illyria and secure our dominion, the formidable barrier of the Serbian Kingdom must be overcome. Whether through diplomacy or by the might of our armies, Serbia must be brought to heel!"

 nicene_balkan_title: "Balkan Domination"
 nicene_balkan_desc: "The Balkans, though fraught with peril, serve as a formidable barrier against our adversaries. Following in the footsteps of our predecessors, we must extend our dominion into the Balkans, fortifying it as our impregnable frontier."

 nicene_east_indies_title: "Golden Chersonese"
 nicene_east_indies_desc: "The Golden Chersonese, a fabled land of untold riches and exotic treasures from the East, has long been a myth whispered among European explorers. But now, as our fleets set sail towards the distant shores of Malaya, we shall unveil the truth behind the legend. The sons and daughters of Hellas will rise to dominance in the global spice trade."

 nicene_massillia_title: "City of Massilia"
 nicene_massillia_desc: "Massilia, once a proud Greek colony in Gaul since antiquity, served as our primary trade port in the region until it fell under the iron grip of the Romans.

 nicene_hercules_title: "Pillars of Hercules"
 nicene_hercules_desc: "The Pillars of Hercules stand as the mountains flanking both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, marking the westernmost extent of Ancient Greek knowledge.

 nicene_odyssey_title: "The Third Odyssey"
 nicene_odyssey_desc: "With the Maghreb under our dominion, we have gained access to the vast Atlantic Ocean. Throughout history, ancient thinkers and cartographers spoke of mysterious lands lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Now, in recent times, we have come to understand that a new world indeed awaits us across the Atlantic. It is a land where we can send troublesome foreign adversaries, ambitious explorers, and resilient settlers by the thousands to establish a new Hellas beyond the Atlantic - Elysia. A new epic journey beckons the bravest of Greek souls."

# Poland Missions
 pol_jerusalem_title: "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 pol_jerusalem_desc: "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rûm may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."

 pol_proclaim_third_rome_title: "Proclaim Third Rome"
 pol_proclaim_third_rome_desc: "We have reconquered the lands once owned by the Second Rome, and while they have faded from history, there exists a movement amongst the clergy to restore the former empire and titles under a personal union. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be both the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Lech and the Basileus of East Rome."

 pol_heal_schism_title: "Mend the Schism"
 pol_heal_schism_desc: "A petty dispute in old days long past shattered the Kingdom of God in two halves - that of the Catholic West and the Orthodox East, or so they are referred to. If we were to elevate the restored pentarchy to a height and honour undeniable to the Catholic West, the truly pious and faithful shall flock to the gates of not only our empire, but His rightful church - that which dwells in Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and the heart of every holy preacher in Europe who knows our glory."

 pol_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 pol_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."

 pol_romania_title: "Balkan Intervention"
 pol_romania_desc: "The next step of our great conquest are the divided states of the Wallachians, Moldavians, and Transylvanians. With these territories under our control, we can then expand further into Europe proper."

 pol_bulgaria_title: "Unite with Bulgaria"
 pol_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria has been the true Orthodox power in the Balkans since the decline of Byzantium. Their literary schools rank among the best in the world for their teachings and efficiency. We will relieve them of the burden of administering their vast state and show them how efficient the Sons of Lech are at ruling."

 pol_panslavism_title: "Embrace Pan-Slavism"
 pol_panslavism_desc: "The three Slavic brothers of Lech, Czech, and Rus have long been separated, but now we have brought the three brothers back together. While we may not agree on religion, with Catholics, Orthodox, and even a few Hussites, we are all Slavs, and we will stand together against all our foes."

 pol_carpathian_hegemony_title: "Carpathian Hegemony"
 pol_carpathian_hegemony_desc: "With the Magyars on the run, we should look to establish a more permanent power base across the Danube. With luck, the whole region can become free of pagans."

 pol_ministries_title: "Imperial Ministries"
 pol_ministries_desc: "The imperial bureaucracy has always been an important part in the imperial administration since ancient times. With the ever expanding borders of our empire many of the old ministries must be revived and new ones must be created. We should reform the various imperial ministries to make it more efficient."

 pol_roman_law_title: "Reform the Roman Law"
 pol_roman_law_desc: "Roman law is the main legal civil judicial codex of the Roman Empire. However, it is an antiquated ruleset and modern problems surely require modern solutions. Therefore we shall reform the Roman law to make it suit the needs of our modern empire."

 pol_nomos_title: "Nomos Empsychos"
 pol_nomos_desc: "Nomos Empsychos, the law animate, decrees that the Emperor and Autocrat of all Romans shall be the final judge on all things judicial. This right has been granted to his imperial majesty by God and none shall defy it."

 pol_megalopolis_title: "The Megalopolis"
 pol_megalopolis_desc: "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 pol_gigalopolis_title: "The Gigalopolis"
 pol_gigalopolis_desc: "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented the plan to renovate [316.GetName] into a part of our Imperial City. From now on, this area should be called the Greater Constantinople Area."

 pol_ecumenopolis_title: "The Ecumenopolis"
 pol_ecumenopolis_desc: "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area. It is us who will make this theory into a reality. The world shall recognize our Imperial City as Caput Mundi - the Head of The World."

 pol_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 pol_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 pol_muskets_title: "Westernise The Army"
 pol_muskets_desc: "The face of warfare has changed significantly. We have lagged behind our western rivals in technological advance. This cannot be ignored. We need to find an ally willing to help us catch up with their military reforms."

 pol_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 pol_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 pol_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 pol_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must booster our number to surpass any adversary."

 pol_money_title: "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 pol_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

 pol_roman_industries_title: "Roman Industries"

 pol_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"
 pol_roads_desc: "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits."

 pol_wonders_title: "Roman Great Wonders"
 pol_wonders_desc: "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

 pol_restored_rome_title: "Imperial Restoration"
 pol_restored_rome_desc: "With the empire restored, it is our destiny to reclaim the Western Empire. As heirs to the great Roman conquests, we are obligated to revive the spirit of the ancient republic and expand our dominion across the Western lands. Let us embark on this noble endeavor and usher in a new era of Roman greatness."

 pol_mecca_title: "The Heart of Islam"
 pol_mecca_desc: "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."

 pol_arelat_title: "Arelat Conquest"
 pol_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."

 pol_iberia_title: "Triumph for Iberia"
 pol_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 pol_dethrone_title: "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 pol_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 pol_alpine_title: "March Across the Alps"
 pol_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 pol_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 pol_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."

 pol_belgica_title: "Roman Belgica"
 pol_belgica_desc: "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants. As a former province of the Roman Empire, it is clear that we hold legitimate claims to the region. By incorporating it, Belgica will thrive even more under our administration."

 pol_cultural_hegemony_title: "Cultural Hegemony"
 pol_cultural_hegemony_desc: "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image.

 pol_germany_title: "Conquer Germany"
 pol_germany_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne.

It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 pol_restoration_title: "Recover Britannia"
 pol_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied.

 pol_ariana_title: "Secure Ariana"
 pol_ariana_desc: "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 pol_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 pol_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower.

 swa_andalusia_title: "Challenge Al-Andalus"
 swa_andalusia_desc: "The dreaded 'Al-Andalus' has been a blight upon Iberia for long enough! The downtrodden Castillians have had a bitter time trying to shed their chains - one we cannot help but relate to, having suffered beneath the insidious Franks for long enough. We will deliver the final blow to the ailing Saracens and remove them for good from the god-given lands of Iberia!"

 swa_invade_france_title: "Westward Expansion"

 swa_latin_empire_title: "The Latin Empire"
 swa_latin_empire_desc: "Across the Straits of Otranto, the Balkans lay inflamed. Muslims encroach upon the ancient mountains of Greece. Where the first Christians once spread the good word, strange barbarians now preach even stranger ways. The Romans of so-called Constantinople have failed. The Bulgarians of Tirnovo cast greedy eyes upon everything in sight. The warlike Nicaeans sharpen their blades with animal glee. None of these powers can be trusted to guard Christendom! Only us, only the West, only a... Latin Empire, perhaps... may preside over Constantinople."

 swa_defeat_heptarchy_title: "Defeat the Heptarchy"
 swa_defeat_heptarchy_desc: "The cold and cruel lords of England beckon to us from across the channel. Hardened by war and the treachery of their internal politics, the wily English plot without end to subjugate anyone who dares pass them by. Unfortunately, existing on their periphery, conducting trade with their merchants, and routinely harassed by their scheming spies, it is inevitable that we shall clash with them. We will never feel secure until the perfidious English are dealt a killing blow!"

 swa_imperial_restoration_title: "Imperial Restoration"

 swa_schism_title: "Mend the Schism"
 swa_schism_desc: "The Eastern Schism marked the final split between the Patriarch of Rome and the Eastern Romans, giving rise to the Western Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy. With Rome restored, we now have the opportunity to mend what was once lost. The healing of the Schism shall be orchestrated by the Papacy itself."

 swa_rus_union_title: "Tsar of Rus"

 swa_control_maghreb_title: "Control Maghreb"
 swa_control_maghreb_desc: "The Berber pirates have ravaged peaceful and idyllic Christian shorelines across the Mediterranean for far too long.

 swa_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 swa_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age.

It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 swa_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 swa_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it.

 swa_grandarmy_title: "Roman Grand Army"
 swa_grandarmy_desc: "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents.

 swa_money_desc: "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century.

 swa_roads_title: "Roman Road Network"

 swa_cities_latin_title: "Latin Metropolises"
 swa_cities_latin_desc: "To govern the Western half of our empire more efficiently, we must establish a system of Latin Metropolises.

 swa_turkmen_title: "Romanize the Steppes"
 swa_turkmen_desc: "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 swa_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 swa_georgia_desc: "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

Today, no formidable rival stands to oppose us in taking this region for ourselves."

 swa_cities_persian_title: "Persian Great Cities"

 swa_invade_china_desc: "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use, better be under our management.

 trc_andalusia_desc: "The dreaded 'Al-Andalus' has been a blight upon Iberia for long enough! The downtrodden Castillians have had a bitter time trying to shed their chains - one we cannot help but relate to, having suffered beneath the insidious Franks for long enough. We will deliver the final blow to the ailing Saracens and remove them for good from the god-given lands of Iberia!"

 trc_defeat_heptarchy_title: "Campaign in Britannia"
 trc_defeat_heptarchy_desc: "The cold and cruel lords of England beckon to us from across the channel. Hardened by war and the treachery of their internal politics, the wily English plot without end to subjugate anyone who dares pass them by.

It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 trc_finest_title: "The Finest Of All"
 trc_finest_desc: "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it.
