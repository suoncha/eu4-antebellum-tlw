 byzantium_anatolia_dev_title:0 "Asian Heartlands"
 byzantium_anatolia_dev_desc:0 "Asia Minor was once the heartland of the Greeks, supplying us with men, wealth, and resources. However, decades of Turkish rule have laid waste to everything we built. We shall restore the region to its former glory."

 byzantium_seleucia_title:0 "Seleucia On The Tigris"
 byzantium_seleucia_desc:0 "After reclaiming the ancient Roman province of Mesopotamia, our soldiers stumbled upon the ruins of what appears to be the ancient capital of the Seleucids.

 byzantium_riches_title:0 "Mesopotamian Riches"
 byzantium_riches_desc:0 "After years under our benevolent rule, Mesopotamia has finally emerged from the shadows of its past, standing as a beacon of prosperity and progress.

 byzantium_bahrain_title:0 "Rebuild Tylos"

 byzantium_rus_union_title:0 "Tsar of Rus"
 byzantium_rus_union_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority."

 byzantium_aquitania_title:0 "Invade Aquitania"
 byzantium_aquitania_desc:0 "With the restoration of Hispania, we now possess a strategic advantage for launching military expeditions into Gallia. Rather than relying on advances from the Alps, reclaiming Aquitania will solidify our defensive line against the Franks."

 byzantium_conquer_seas_desc:0 "Though arriving late to the colonization endeavor, the vastness of the seas remains unclaimed. However, this situation is set to change, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has laid claim to every corner of the globe, marking the dawn of the Roman colonialism."

 byzantium_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"
 byzantium_punics_desc:0 "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them will be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god can save them this time!"

 byzantium_fortify_rhine_title:0 "Fortify Rhine"
 byzantium_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter.

 byzantium_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 byzantium_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants.

 byzantium_cultural_hegemony_title:0 "Cultural Hegemony"

This establishes our cultural supremacy over all nations, ensuring that the world reflects the grandeur of Rome."

 byzantium_germany_title:0 "Conquer Germany"
 byzantium_germany_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 byzantium_europe_title:0 "Roma Europa"

 byzantium_general_staff_title:0 "Strategos Office"
 byzantium_general_staff_desc:0 "As Alexander said, 'An army of sheep led by a lion is better than an army of lions led by a sheep.' Undeniably, we have many gifted Strategoi scattered across our nation, yet they hardly cooperate with each other. To address this issue, we should establish a central headquarters to deliver our battle commands from a single place and to gather hidden gems among our citizens."

 byzantium_finest_title:0 "The Finest Of All"
 byzantium_finest_desc:0 "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 byzantium_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 byzantium_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents.

 byzantium_library_desc:0 "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia.

 byzantium_ecumenopolis_title:0 "The Ecumenopolis"
 byzantium_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area.

 byzantium_docks_title:0 "Expand The Kontoskalion"
 byzantium_docks_desc:0 "The Kontoskalion, once the bustling main port of Constantinople, rivaled only by the Prosphorion harbour, saw its trade activities dwindle during the tumultuous 13th century crisis.

 byzantium_money_title:0 "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 byzantium_money_desc:0 "The Hyperpyron, introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos during the late Middle Ages, replaced the Solidus as our standard gold coin. While it remained in use until the mid-14th century, our ancestors ceased minting them. However, we could consider reissuing them as our new currency to combat against inflation."

 byzantium_roads_title:0 "Roman Road Network"
 byzantium_roads_desc:0 "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits."

 byzantium_wonders_title:0 "Roman Great Wonders"
 byzantium_wonders_desc:0 "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

 byzantium_caesaropapism_title:0 "Caesaropapism"
 byzantium_caesaropapism_desc:0 "Caesaropapism, a political system merging state and church authority under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has emerged.

 byzantium_persia_title:0 "Conquest of Persia"
 byzantium_persia_desc:0 "As the victor of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories.

 byzantium_persosphere_title:0 "Persian Administration"
 byzantium_persosphere_desc:0 "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia.

 byzantium_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 byzantium_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 byzantium_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 byzantium_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 byzantium_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 byzantium_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

 byzantium_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 byzantium_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"

 byzantium_invade_china_title:0 "Invade China"
 byzantium_invade_china_desc:0 "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use, better be under our management.

 byzantium_far_east_title:0 "Conqueror of Far East"
 byzantium_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long.

 ser_roman_ambition_title:0 "Roman Ambition"
 ser_roman_ambition_desc:0 "Reclaiming the ancient borders of the Eastern Roman Empire marks a significant milestone in our quest to revive the glory of Rome. Yet, our ambitions do not end there. We must set our sights on a grander vision - to restore the vast territories once ruled by Emperor Justinian. By doing so, we will not only revive the legitimate Rome but also usher in a new era of prosperity and power for our people."

 ser_iron_title:0 "Claim the Iron Crown"
 ser_iron_desc:0 "Northern Italia fancies itself a loose mess of independent imbeciles, deluded duchies and babbling buffoons, swimming in more undeserved wealth and squandered manpower than they know what to do with. Crushing this sad state of disunity by smothering the peninsula's remaining vestiges of power and sovereignity will signal to the world who the true masters of Italia are."

 ser_rus_union_title:0 "Tsar of Rus"
 ser_rus_union_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority."

 ser_alexandria_title:0 "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 ser_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."

 ser_jerusalem_title:0 "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 ser_jerusalem_desc:0 "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rome reborn may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."

 ser_reform_imperial_army_title:0 "Reform the Imperial Army"
 ser_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."

 ser_muskets_title:0 "Westernise The Army"
 ser_muskets_desc:0 "The face of warfare has changed significantly. We have lagged behind our western rivals in technological advance. This cannot be ignored. We need to find an ally willing to help us catch up with their military reforms."

 ser_finest_title:0 "The Finest Of All"
 ser_finest_desc:0 "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 ser_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 ser_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must booster our number to surpass any adversary."

 ser_money_title:0 "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 ser_money_desc:0 "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

 ser_roman_industries_title:0 "Roman Industries"
 ser_roman_industries_desc:0 "As technology advances, traditional manufacturing methods become obsolete. To maintain our status as a great power, we must embrace these innovations and modernize our production processes to outpace our rivals."

 ser_roads_title:0 "Roman Road Network"
 ser_roads_desc:0 "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits."

 ser_wonders_title:0 "Roman Great Wonders"
 ser_wonders_desc:0 "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the ancient wisdom."

 ser_restored_rome_title:0 "Western Reconquest"
 ser_restored_rome_desc:0 "With the empire restored, it is our destiny to reclaim the Western Empire. As heirs to the great Roman conquests, we are obligated to revive the spirit of the ancient republic and expand our dominion across the Western lands. Let us embark on this noble endeavor and usher in a new era of Roman greatness."

 ser_mecca_title:0 "The Heart of Islam"
 ser_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."

 ser_arelat_title:0 "Arelat Conquest"
 ser_arelat_desc:0 "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."

 ser_iberia_title:0 "Triumph for Iberia"
 ser_iberia_desc:0 "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 ser_dethrone_title:0 "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 ser_dethrone_desc:0 "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 ser_alpine_title:0 "March Across the Alps"
 ser_alpine_desc:0 "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 ser_rhine_title:0 "The Rhenish Border"
 ser_rhine_desc:0 "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."

 ser_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 ser_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants. As a former province of the Roman Empire, it is clear that we hold legitimate claims to the region. By incorporating it, Belgica will thrive even more under our administration."

 ser_cultural_hegemony_title:0 "Cultural Hegemony"
 ser_cultural_hegemony_desc:0 "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image. This establishes our cultural supremacy over all nations, ensuring that the world reflects the grandeur of Rome."

 ser_fortify_rhine_title:0 "Fortify Rhine"
 ser_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."

 ser_germany_title:0 "Conquer Germany"
 ser_germany_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 ser_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 ser_restoration_desc:0 "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

 ser_europe_title:0 "Roma Europa"
 ser_europe_desc:0 "The opportunity to unify Europa under Roman banners has arrived. With the mighty Dioceses by our side, all of Europe will finally be united under one single nation. The eternal peace shall be brought upon this continent for eons to come, as long as Rome endures."

 ser_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 ser_odyssey_desc:0 "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 ser_newworld_base_title:0 "New World Base"
 ser_newworld_base_desc:0 "After extensive exploration to the West, we have made a startling discovery about the Punics who have managed to escape their demise by fleeing to the New World. Preparations will be done for the inevitable conflict ahead."

 ser_conquer_seas_title:0 "Conquer the Seas"
 ser_conquer_seas_desc:0 "Though arriving late to the colonization endeavor, the vastness of the seas remains unclaimed. However, this situation is set to change, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has laid claim to every corner of the globe, marking the dawn of the Roman colonialism."

 ser_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"
 ser_punics_desc:0 "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them will be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god can save them this time!"

 ser_cities_byzantine_title:0 "Byzantine Great Cities"
 ser_cities_byzantine_desc:0 "The Great Cities of Byzantium were the beating hearts of the Hellenosphere, bustling hubs of economic and cultural activity, each home to hundreds of thousands. To secure a stable economy, it is imperative that we breathe new life into these once-great centers."

 ser_cities_latin_title:0 "Latin Metropolises"
 ser_cities_latin_desc:0 "To govern the Western half of our empire more efficiently, we must establish a system of Latin Metropolises. These will serve as the capital cities of the Latinsphere, acting as central hubs for both governance and the process of Romanization among the European population."

 ser_sophia_title:0 "Renovate Hagia Sophia"
 ser_sophia_desc:0 "As the head of the Orthodox Christian Church, the Hagia Sophia is a symbol of Orthodox authority and unity. We must renovate the Hagia Sophia to once again show the Orthodox and Catholic world our claim to the entirety of Christendom."

 ser_university_title:0 "Revive the Pandidakterion"
 ser_university_desc:0 "The Pandidakterion, a grand center of learning in Constantinople, has fallen into disuse over the past millenia due to wars and disasters. However, with the resurgence of our empire and a revival in cultural interests, we should revive the Pandidakterion to encourage higher education."

 ser_ministries_title:0 "Imperial Ministries"
 ser_ministries_desc:0 "The imperial bureaucracy has always been an important part in the imperial administration since ancient times. With the ever expanding borders of our empire many of the old ministries must be revived and new ones must be created. We should reform the various imperial ministries to make it more efficient."

 ser_nomos_title:0 "Nomos Empsychos"
 ser_nomos_desc:0 "Nomos Empsychos, the law animate, decrees that the Emperor and Autocrat of all Romans shall be the final judge on all things judicial. This right has been granted to his imperial majesty by God and none shall defy it."

 ser_library_title:0 "The Great Library"
 ser_library_desc:0 "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia. Unfortunately, it was destroyed multiple times by fires and barbarians who disregarded its valuable contents. It's time to rebuild this unparalleled source of knowledge."

 ser_wall_title:0 "Theodosian Walls"
 ser_wall_desc:0 "The Theodosian Walls have defended the city of Constantinople for centuries and will continue to be its primary defence during sieges for centuries to come. It is time for us to extend and renovate the wall, due to the recent growth of Constantinople."

 ser_megalopolis_title:0 "The Megalopolis"
 ser_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."

 ser_gigalopolis_title:0 "The Gigalopolis"
 ser_gigalopolis_desc:0 "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented the plan to renovate [316.GetName] into a part of our Imperial City. From now on, this area should be called the Greater Constantinople Area."

 ser_ecumenopolis_title:0 "The Ecumenopolis"
 ser_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area. It is us who will make this theory into a reality. The world shall recognize our Imperial City as Caput Mundi - the Head of The World."

 ser_persia_title:0 "Conquest of Persia"
 ser_persia_desc:0 "As the victor of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories. Persia, famed for its opulence and treasures, promises untold riches to those who conquer it. The bountiful wealth of Persian cities will enrich our empire immeasurably."

 ser_persosphere_title:0 "Persian Administration"
 ser_persosphere_desc:0 "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within Rome."

 ser_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 ser_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 ser_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 ser_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 ser_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 ser_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears. Over the eons, the rugged terrain of Georgia, Armenia, and the Caucasus Mountains has witnessed the clash of friends and foes alike.

 ser_cities_persian_title:0 "Persian Great Cities"
 ser_cities_persian_desc:0 "The Great Cities of Persia are the beating hearts of the political, economic, and cultural realms in the Persosphere.

 ser_invade_india_title:0 "Invade India"
 ser_invade_india_desc:0 "The Indus Valley stands as the pivotal gateway to Indian riches. By conquering this strategic region, we not only gain a valuable vantage point but also sever a crucial artery of Indian manpower and supplies. This campaign promises to open new avenues of opportunity and strengthen our foothold in the subcontinent."

 ser_maharajas_title:0 "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ser_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 ser_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"
 ser_tibet_desc:0 "Tibet is the natural border dividing the Sinosphere from India, protecting the western flank of China. Its conquest would leave the entire subcontinent vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Rome."

 ser_burma_title:0 "Conquer Burma"
 ser_burma_desc:0 "Burma stands as the gateway to the East Indies - a vast subcontinent holding infinite wealth. Its strategic position, nestled among mountain ranges and with access to the Malayan Sea, makes it a valuable military base. This region will be the stepping stone for our conquest of Southeast Asia."

 ser_invade_china_title:0 "Invade China"
 ser_invade_china_desc:0 "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use, better be under our management.

 ser_mongolia_title:0 "Subjugate the Mongols"
 ser_mongolia_desc:0 "The vast northern steppes of Mongolia are scattered with petty chiefdoms of the Mongols. Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."

 ser_far_east_title:0 "Conqueror of Far East"
 ser_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long. It is evident that we must intervene decisively to put an end to their conflict and restore peace and stability to the region. By incorporating both kingdoms under the jurisdiction of a Diocese, we can ensure a unified and harmonious administration that benefits all."

 ser_indochina_title:0 "Rule Indochina"
 ser_indochina_desc:0 "The triumph of our conquests in Asia has elevated our pride and glory to unprecedented heights. To sustain this momentum, we must seek new conquests. Indochina beckons, its lands ripe for submission to Rome. Let us extend our dominion and usher its citizens into our fold."

 ser_asia_desc:0 "Rome's greatness has long been undisputed, yet its identity as a purely European empire has often been questioned in comparison to the grand Asian empires of old. However, this debate will soon be put to rest as we stand on the brink of a historic achievement. With our imminent conquest of Asia, Rome will transcend its European origins and rightfully claim its place among the legendary empires of antiquity."

The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 ab_russia_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 ab_russia_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents.

 ab_russia_iberia_title:0 "Triumph for Iberia"
 ab_russia_iberia_desc:0 "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance.

 ab_russia_dethrone_title:0 "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 ab_russia_dethrone_desc:0 "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 ab_russia_alpine_title:0 "March Across the Alps"
 ab_russia_alpine_desc:0 "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 ab_russia_rhine_title:0 "The Rhenish Border"
 ab_russia_rhine_desc:0 "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever.

 ab_russia_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 ab_russia_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants.

 ab_russia_cultural_hegemony_title:0 "Cultural Hegemony"
 ab_russia_cultural_hegemony_desc:0 "The differences in our ways of life lead to instability and conflict. By spreading Roman ideals and traditions globally, we can shape societies in our image.

 ab_russia_fortify_rhine_title:0 "Fortify Rhine"
 ab_russia_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter.

 ab_russia_germany_title:0 "Conquer Germany"
 ab_russia_germany_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 ab_russia_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 ab_russia_restoration_desc:0 "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

 ab_russia_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 ab_russia_odyssey_desc:0 "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 ab_russia_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"

 ab_russia_persosphere_title:0 "Persian Administration"
 ab_russia_persosphere_desc:0 "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within Rome."

 ab_russia_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 ab_russia_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. We must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."

 ab_russia_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 ab_russia_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. By assimilating additional tribes, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of Rome would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."

 ab_russia_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 ab_russia_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

Today, no formidable rival stands to oppose us in taking this region for ourselves."

 ab_russia_cities_persian_title:0 "Persian Great Cities"

 ab_russia_maharajas_title:0 "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ab_russia_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, the Maharajas are pale in comparison to the might of our legions. The riches of India are ours alone to claim."

 ab_russia_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"

 ab_russia_mongolia_desc:0 "The vast northern steppes of Mongolia are scattered with petty chiefdoms of the Mongols. Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."

 ab_russia_far_east_title:0 "Conqueror of Far East"
 ab_russia_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long.

 rum_christian_march_rome_title:0 "March on Rome"
 rum_christian_march_rome_desc:0 "'The Eternal City'. 'Caput Mundi'. 'City of God'. Rome has had many a name. As we march to take back the city, however, there are but four words that echo in the mind of every true son of Rome. 'Nostra Civitas'. Our city. 'Cor Nostrum'. Our heart."

 rum_christian_jerusalem_title:0 "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 rum_christian_jerusalem_desc:0 "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin.

 rum_christian_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria, as well as Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during Byzantine rule.

 rum_christian_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community.

 rum_christian_rus_union_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority."

 rum_christian_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age.

Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."

 rum_christian_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 rum_christian_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents.

 rum_christian_money_desc:0 "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, was introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, replacing the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."

We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."

 rum_christian_dethrone_title:0 "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 rum_christian_dethrone_desc:0 "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."

 rum_christian_alpine_title:0 "March Across the Alps"
 rum_christian_alpine_desc:0 "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."

 rum_christian_rhine_title:0 "The Rhenish Border"
 rum_christian_rhine_desc:0 "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever.

 rum_christian_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 rum_christian_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants.

 rum_christian_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter.

 rum_christian_germany_title:0 "Conquer Germany"
 rum_christian_germany_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of the ancient Rome, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."

 rum_christian_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 rum_christian_restoration_desc:0 "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

 rum_christian_university_desc:0 "The Pandidakterion, a grand center of learning in Constantinople, has fallen into disuse over the past millenia due to wars and disasters.

 rum_christian_caesaropapism_title:0 "Caesaropapism"
 rum_christian_caesaropapism_desc:0 "Caesaropapism, a political system merging state and church authority under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has emerged. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wields unparalleled control over both secular and religious domains, ensuring the welfare of Christian subjects. This consolidation grants absolute dominion over ecclesiastical matters, thus firmly establishing authority over the Church."

 rum_christian_nomos_title:0 "Nomos Empsychos"

 rum_christian_megalopolis_title:0 "The Megalopolis"
 rum_christian_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."

 rum_christian_gigalopolis_title:0 "The Gigalopolis"
 rum_christian_gigalopolis_desc:0 "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented the plan to renovate [316.GetName] into a part of our Imperial City. From now on, this area should be called the Greater Constantinople Area."

 rum_christian_ecumenopolis_title:0 "The Ecumenopolis"
 rum_christian_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from the Greek city planners, describing a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area.

 rum_christian_persia_title:0 "Conquest of Persia"
 rum_christian_persia_desc:0 "As the victor of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories.

 rum_christian_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 rum_christian_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies.

 rum_christian_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 rum_christian_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order.

 rum_christian_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 rum_christian_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears.

 rum_christian_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority.

 rum_christian_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"
 rum_christian_tibet_desc:0 "Tibet is the natural border dividing the Sinosphere from India, protecting the western flank of China. Its conquest would leave the entire subcontinent vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Rome."

 rum_christian_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long.

 nicene_reform_hellenic_title:0 "Hellenic Reformation"
 nicene_reform_hellenic_desc:0 "As the wave of the Reformation sweeps across the Christian world, threatening to divide their faith further, we must be wary of its potential impact on our own borders. The Greek population, deeply rooted in Orthodoxy, may be susceptible to similar religious divergence. To prevent this, we must undertake a reformation of the Hellenic faith, uniting the children of Hellas under a single religious banner."

 nicene_women_of_greece_title:0 "Women of Hellas"
 nicene_women_of_greece_desc:0 "Throughout ancient history, women have held significant positions in Greek society, with figures like Queen Gorgo of Sparta standing as powerful examples. To further empower women and harness their potential, we shall initiate an innovative movement known as 'Feminism,' encouraging their participation in our administration system."

 nicene_orthodoxy_title:0 "Hellenic Orthodoxy"
 nicene_orthodoxy_desc:0 "After centuries of enduring the Roman yoke, the first sparks of a new Orthodox faith under true Greek cultural leadership have finally begun to emerge. We must nurture these sparks and fuel their growth. The Church of Orthodoxy shall be purified and cleansed of Roman influence, replaced by the Greek identity."

 nicene_hellenic_islamization_title:0 "Hellenic Islamization"
 nicene_hellenic_islamization_desc:0 "The Hellenization of our esteemed nation must coincide with Islamization. This dual process is marked by distinct challenges: firstly, a significant portion of our populace adheres to Orthodoxy, necessitating their contentment while fostering their conversion to the path of Allah. Secondly, our conquest targets, Anatolia and the Levant, harbor a Muslim population aligned with the erroneous sect. Only Shia Islam holds the truth!"

 nicene_golden_age_islam_title:0 "Rekindle the Golden Age"
 nicene_golden_age_islam_desc:0 "The illustrious era of Islam's Golden Age waned with the onslaught of the Crusaders and the Mongols.

 nicene_east_indies_title:0 "Golden Chersonese"
 nicene_east_indies_desc:0 "The Golden Chersonese, a fabled land of untold riches and exotic treasures from the East, has long been a myth whispered among European explorers. But now, as our fleets set sail towards the distant shores of Malaya, we shall unveil the truth behind the legend. The sons and daughters of Hellas will rise to dominance in the global spice trade."

 nicene_massillia_title:0 "City of Massilia"

 nicene_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 nicene_odyssey_desc:0 "With the Maghreb under our dominion, we have gained access to the vast Atlantic Ocean. Throughout history, ancient thinkers and cartographers spoke of mysterious lands lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Now, in recent times, we have come to understand that a new world indeed awaits us across the Atlantic. It is a land where we can send troublesome foreign adversaries, ambitious explorers, and resilient settlers by the thousands to establish a new Hellas beyond the Atlantic - Elysia. A new epic journey beckons the bravest of Greek souls."
