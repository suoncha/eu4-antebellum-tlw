 byzantium_anatolia_dev_desc:0 "Asia Minor was once the heartland of the Greeks, supplying us with men, wealth, and resources. However, decades of Turkish rule have laid waste to everything we built. This injustice must be rectified."
 byzantium_seleucia_title:0 "Seleucia On The Tigris"
 byzantium_seleucia_desc:0 "After reclaiming the ancient Roman province of Mesopotamia, our soldiers stumbled upon the ruins of what appears to be the ancient capital of the Seleucids. Abandoned for centuries, it stood as a silent witness to the ebb and flow of history. We must rebuild this city and repopulate it, a testament to our dominance in the region and a symbol of our enduring legacy."
 byzantium_riches_title:0 "Mesopotamian Riches"
 byzantium_riches_desc:0 "After years under our benevolent rule, Mesopotamia has finally emerged from the shadows of its past. It now stands as a beacon of prosperity and progress, a testament to our commitment to revitalizing the region. Yet, our work is far from over.

 byzantium_bahrain_title:0 "Rebuild Tylos"
 byzantium_bahrain_desc:0 "Tylos, once a bustling Greek city in the classical era, held a pivotal role as a center of maritime trade and pearl diving in the Erythraean Sea.

However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority. It is imperative that we bring Rus into our sphere of influence and assert our rightful control over religious matters in the region."
 byzantium_aquitania_title:0 "Invade Aquitania"
 byzantium_aquitania_desc:0 "With the restoration of Hispania, we now possess a strategic advantage for launching military expeditions into Gallia. Rather than relying on advances from the Alps, reclaiming Aquitania will solidify our defensive line against the Franks."

 byzantium_conquer_seas_title:0 "Conquer the Seas"
 byzantium_conquer_seas_desc:0 "Though arriving late to the colonization endeavor, the vastness of the seas remains unclaimed. However, our fate is set to change. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decreed that Romans are the rightful conquerors of both land and sea. Henceforth, our colonists shall extend our reach to every corner of the globe."
 byzantium_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"
 byzantium_punics_desc:0 "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them shall be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god shall save them this time!"
 byzantium_fortify_rhine_title:0 "Fortify Rhine"
 byzantium_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."
 byzantium_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 byzantium_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants. As a former province of the Roman Empire, it is clear that we hold legitimate claims to the region. By incorporating it, Belgica will thrive even more under our administration."
 byzantium_germany_title:0 "Destroy the False Empire"
 byzantium_germany_desc:0 "We haven't forgotten the debt that the treacherous Germans owe us - the fall of the Western Empire. What's more, they even rubbed salt into the wound by proclaiming a knockoff of our empire and dared to call it "Holy" to distinguish it from us! This joke must end now, as there is only one true Roman Empire in the world. Let us shatter the pretender empire forever."
 byzantium_europe_title:0 "Roma Europa"
 byzantium_europe_desc:0 "The opportunity to unify Europa under Roman banners has arrived. With the mighty Rus by our side, all of Europe will finally be united under one faith, one culture, one empire. This is the true Pax Romana that we have been seeking for millennia.

 byzantium_muskets_title:0 "Westernise The Army"
 byzantium_muskets_desc:0 "This is not the era of swords and slingers; we have significantly lagged behind our western rivals as the battlefield has shifted to guns and cannons. This cannot be ignored. We need to find an ally willing to help us catch up with their military advancements."
 byzantium_cannons_title:0 "Artillery Regiments"
 byzantium_cannons_desc:0 "The adoption of artillery on the battlefield has rendered our famed heavy cataphracts useless. We must fight fire with fire. Let us incorporate artillery regiments into our army."
 byzantium_general_staff_title:0 "Strategos Office"
 byzantium_general_staff_desc:0 "As Alexander said, 'An army of sheep led by a lion is better than an army of lions led by a sheep.' Undeniably, we have many gifted Strategoi scattered across our nation, yet they hardly cooperate with each other. To address this issue, we should establish a central headquarters to deliver our battle commands from a single place and to gather hidden gems among our citizens."
 byzantium_finest_title:0 "The Finest Of All"
 byzantium_finest_desc:0 "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."
 byzantium_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 byzantium_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must establish the Roman Grand Army to guard every corner of the Empire."
 byzantium_library_title:0 "The Great Library"
 byzantium_library_desc:0 "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia.

 byzantium_gigalopolis_desc:0 "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen.

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was highly impressed by this proposal and has officially named it the Greater Constantinople Area."
 byzantium_ecumenopolis_title:0 "The Ecumenopolis"
 byzantium_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from Greek city planning, envisions a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area. With the entirety of the world now under Roman rule, this theory is poised to become a reality. Our Imperial City shall be hailed as the Caput Mundi—the Head of The World."
 byzantium_docks_title:0 "Expand The Kontoskalion"
 byzantium_docks_desc:0 "The Kontoskalion, once the bustling main port of Constantinople, rivaled only by the Prosphorion harbour, saw its trade activities dwindle during the tumultuous 13th century crisis.

 byzantium_cities_title:0 "Byzantine Great Cities"

 byzantium_cities_latin_desc:0 "To govern the Western half of our empire more efficiently, we must establish a system of Latin Metropolises.

 byzantium_money_title:0 "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 byzantium_money_desc:0 "The Hyperpyron, introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos during the late Middle Ages, replaced the Solidus as our standard gold coin. While it remained in use until the mid-14th century, our ancestors ceased minting them. However, we could consider reissuing them as our new currency."
 byzantium_roads_title:0 "Roman Road Network"
 byzantium_roads_desc:0 "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits, both civilian and military."
 byzantium_wonders_title:0 "Roman Great Wonders"
 byzantium_wonders_desc:0 "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the wisdom of our predecessors."
 byzantium_caesaropapism_title:0 "Caesaropapism"
 byzantium_caesaropapism_desc:0 "Caesaropapism, a political system merging state and church authority under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has emerged. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wields unparalleled control over both secular and religious domains, ensuring the welfare of Christian subjects. This consolidation grants absolute dominion over ecclesiastical matters, thus firmly establishing authority over the Church."
 byzantium_industry_title:0 "Roman Industries"

 byzantium_italian_war_title:0 "The Italian League"
 byzantium_italian_war_desc:0 "The Italians, emboldened by our internal struggles, have formed a league and demand Italy from us. The strength of Rome is now being tested by the Catholic world. Should we swiftly defeat them, we could deal such a blow to the Italians that they would be compelled to withdraw from the Empire, restoring our dominance."
 byzantium_italian_war_locked_title:0 "Timed Mission"
 byzantium_italian_war_locked_desc:0 "You can unlock this mission by being at war with the §YItalian League§! in the §YCrisis of the Sixteenth Century§! disaster."
 byzantium_persia_title:0 "Conquest of Persia"
 byzantium_persia_desc:0 "As victors of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories. Persia, famed for its opulence and treasures, promises untold riches to those who conquer it. The bountiful wealth of Persian cities will enrich our empire immeasurably. Let Iran fall under our sway!"
 byzantium_persosphere_title:0 "Persian Administration"
 byzantium_persosphere_desc:0 "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia. Their legacy is extensive and profound, reaching far and wide. It would be remiss of us not to incorporate their expertise into our bureaucracy. The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within the Roman Empire, alongside Latin and Greek."
 byzantium_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 byzantium_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. As we acclimate to the terrain of Persia, we must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."
 byzantium_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 byzantium_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. However, our nobility contemplates further expansion. By assimilating additional tribes into our hegemony and integrating strategically vital territories, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of the Grand Diocese would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."
 byzantium_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 byzantium_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears. Over the eons, the rugged terrain of Georgia, Armenia, and the Caucasus Mountains has witnessed the clash of Roman, Persian, and mercenary forces, each leaving their mark upon the ancient, weathered valleys. Today, no formidable empire stands to oppose us. The region lies ripe for the taking, beckoning us to assert our dominance, to claim it as our own."
 byzantium_cities_persian_title:0 "Persian Great Cities"
 byzantium_cities_persian_desc:0 "The Persian Great Cities stand as the beating heart of the political, economic, and cultural realms in the Persian domain. Their restoration to their former grandeur promises to enrich our Empire manifold. Positioned as key hubs along the trade routes from Constantinople to India and China, these cities are poised to catalyze unprecedented prosperity for our realm."
 byzantium_invade_india_title:0 "Invade India"
 byzantium_invade_india_desc:0 "The Indus Valley stands as a crossroads of cultures, a testament to the rise and fall of empires, and a pivotal gateway to India's riches. By conquering this strategic region, we not only gain a valuable vantage point but also sever a crucial artery of Indian manpower and supplies. This conquest promises to open new avenues of opportunity and strengthen our foothold in the subcontinent."
 byzantium_maharajas_title:0 "Defeat the Maharajas"
 byzantium_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, every minor Indian king lays claim to this prestigious title, diluting its significance. We shall demonstrate to these pretenders that they pale in comparison to the might of the Roman legions."
 byzantium_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"
 byzantium_tibet_desc:0 "Tibet stands as the natural border, dividing the Sinosphere from India. Its conquest would leave China vulnerable and defenseless against the onslaught of Roman legions."
 byzantium_burma_title:0 "Conquer Burma"
 byzantium_burma_desc:0 "Burma stands as the gateway to the East Indies—a vast subcontinent holding infinite wealth. Its strategic position, nestled among mountain ranges and with access to the Malayan Sea, makes it a valuable base for both our Imperial Army and Navy. From here, we can launch military campaigns into China from the South and into the East Indies from the sea. Total control of Burma will be the stepping stone for our conquest of Southeast Asia."
 byzantium_invade_china_title:0 "Invade China"
 byzantium_invade_china_desc:0 "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use—starting with the conquest of China itself. With the Dragon Throne toppled, no opponent could stand in the way of our advance into this rich subcontinent."
 byzantium_china_title:0 "Roma Sinae"
 byzantium_china_desc:0 "To establish our authority as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of China and earn the respect of the region, we must bring the heart of the Sinosphere under our control through the conquest of the entire subcontinent. It is our destiny to reign for ten thousand years, for the Romans are the true Sons of Heaven."
 byzantium_cities_chinese_title:0 "Chinese Metropolises"
 byzantium_cities_chinese_desc:0 "We shall erect grand metropolises across China. Several key cities, already thriving with wealth from the industrial revolution and trade, have displayed immense potential for expansion. This will serve as a splendid showcase of our economic prowess."
 byzantium_mongolia_title:0 "Subjugate the Mongols"
 byzantium_mongolia_desc:0 "The vast northern steppes of Mongolia are scattered with petty chiefdoms of the Mongols. Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."
 byzantium_far_east_title:0 "Conqueror of Far East"
 byzantium_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long. It is evident that we must intervene decisively to put an end to their conflict and restore peace and stability to the region. By incorporating both kingdoms under the jurisdiction of a Diocese, we can ensure a unified and harmonious administration that benefits all."
 byzantium_indochina_title:0 "Rule Indochina"
 byzantium_indochina_desc:0 "The triumph of our conquests in China has elevated our pride and glory to unprecedented heights, casting a mighty smoke that reaches beyond its borders. Yet, to sustain this momentum and further magnify our nation's greatness, we must seek new conquests. Indochina beckons, its lands ripe for submission to the rule of the Imperial Throne. Let us extend our dominion and usher its citizens into the fold of our empire, adding yet another jewel to our crown of conquests."
 byzantium_east_indies_title:0 "Dominate South East Asia"
 byzantium_east_indies_desc:0 "The allure of the East Indies is undeniable, with its exotic spices coveted by all within our empire. To secure our monopoly on these prized commodities and enrich the palates of our people, we must extend our dominion over the entire region. By subjugating the East Indies, we shall ensure a steady and exclusive supply of these coveted spices, bringing new flavors and experiences to every corner of our realm."
 byzantium_asia_title:0 "Roma Asia"
 byzantium_asia_desc:0 "Rome's greatness has long been undisputed, yet its identity as a purely European empire has often been questioned in comparison to the grand Asian empires of old. However, this debate will soon be put to rest as we stand on the brink of a historic achievement: the unification of both continents under our banner. With our imminent conquest of Asia, Rome will transcend its European origins and rightfully claim its place among the legendary Asian empires of antiquity."

 ser_roman_ambition_desc:0 "Reclaiming the ancient borders of the Eastern Roman Empire marks a significant milestone in our quest to revive the glory of Rome. Yet, our ambitions do not end there. We must set our sights on a grander vision: the restoration of the vast territories once ruled by Emperor Justinian. By doing so, we will not only revive the rightful Roman Empire but also usher in a new era of prosperity and power for our people."
 ser_iron_title:0 "Claim the Iron Crown"
 ser_iron_desc:0 "Northern Italy presents itself as a fractured landscape, teeming with self-proclaimed rulers and misguided ambitions. These fragmented duchies and squabbling entities hoard wealth and manpower, oblivious to their own weaknesses. It is imperative that we bring an end to this chaos by asserting our dominance over the remnants of power and sovereignty in the peninsula. Only then will the world recognize the true masters of Italy."
 ser_rus_union_title:0 "Tsar of Rus"
 ser_rus_union_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church, with its center in Constantinople, has long served as a unifying force for our faith. However, our Slavic brethren in Rus hold different views, refusing to recognize the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Such dissent cannot be tolerated, as it threatens the unity of our church and undermines our authority. It is imperative that we bring Rus into our sphere of influence and assert our rightful control over religious matters in the region."
 ser_reform_imperial_army_title:0 "Reform the Imperial Army"
 ser_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "Despite our storied history of facing the Eastern threats head-on, our imperial army remains stagnant in this ever-evolving era. The petty duchies and warring kingdoms of Europe have honed their military prowess, benefiting from the wealth and prosperity they have amassed. It is high time we adapt and modernize our forces, showcasing Rome's true military might to the world."
 ser_muskets_title:0 "Westernise The Army"
 ser_muskets_desc:0 "This is not the era of swords and slingers; we have significantly lagged behind our western rivals as the battlefield has shifted to guns and cannons. This cannot be ignored. We need to find an ally willing to help us catch up with their military advancements."
 ser_finest_title:0 "The Finest Of All"
 ser_finest_desc:0 "Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will ensure it. The old Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Thus, to prepare for our world conquest, we must ensure that our army is the finest in the world."
 ser_grandarmy_title:0 "Roman Grand Army"
 ser_grandarmy_desc:0 "Despite our invincible status, we are always outnumbered and outmatched in manpower by our opponents. Much of the time, the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas, which led to the downfall of the old Empire. Hence, we must establish the Roman Grand Army to guard every corner of the Empire."
 ser_money_title:0 "Reissue the Hyperpyron"
 ser_money_desc:0 "The Hyperpyron, once the prized coin of the Byzantine Empire during the late Middle Ages, stood as a symbol of prosperity and stability. Introduced by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, it replaced the Solidus and remained the standard gold currency until the mid-14th century. In light of our glorious heritage, the reissuing of the Hyperpyron as our new currency would not only honor our illustrious past but also signal our commitment to reclaiming our former glory."
 ser_industry_title:0 "Roman Industries"
 ser_industry_desc:0 "As technology advances, traditional manufacturing methods become obsolete. To maintain our status as a great power, we must embrace these innovations and modernize our production processes to outpace our rivals."
 ser_roads_title:0 "Roman Road Network"
 ser_roads_desc:0 "The Romans built an extensive network of modern roads to connect every corner of their vast empire, greatly reducing travel time. Unfortunately, years of wars and mismanagement have left them decrepit. We should work to repair and modernize them, as this will provide us with many benefits, both civilian and military."
 ser_wonders_title:0 "Roman Great Wonders"
 ser_wonders_desc:0 "While our engineering prowess surpasses that of conquered civilizations, their ancient wonders stand as testament to their ingenuity and cultural significance. Perhaps it's time to set aside our pride and glean knowledge from their architectural marvels, embracing the wisdom of our predecessors."
 ser_restored_rome_title:0 "Western Reconquest"
 ser_restored_rome_desc:0 "With the Empire restored to its former glory, we stand poised to reclaim what was once rightfully ours - the Western Empire. As heirs to the legacy of the great Roman conquests of old, it is our duty to revive the spirit of the ancient republic and expand our dominion across the Western lands. Let us embark on this noble endeavor and usher in a new era of Roman greatness!"
 ser_mecca_title:0 "The Heart of Islam"
 ser_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca, the heart of the Muslim world, stands as a symbol of their conquests and triumphs over our once-mighty empire. Yet, as the tides of history shift, so too do the fortunes of nations. It is time for us to reclaim what was once ours by seizing this sacred city and transforming it into a beacon of our faith. The irony of converting Mecca into a church will surely resonate throughout the ages, marking our victory over our adversaries and the resurgence of our empire."
 ser_arelat_title:0 "Arelat Conquest"
 ser_arelat_desc:0 "The riches of Eastern Gaul have long been squandered by petty princes and squabbling factions. The Germanic tribes and Franks vie for control, oblivious to the greater power looming on the horizon. By sweeping through these fractured lands, we pave the way for the resurgence of Roman authority in Gaul proper."
 ser_iberia_title:0 "Triumph for Iberia"
 ser_iberia_desc:0 "With the Muslims reeling from our relentless campaigns, Hispania lies vulnerable, ripe for the taking. We must seize this opportunity to reclaim the entire peninsula, restoring Roman rule to its war-torn valleys. The fractured Christian kingdoms of Hispania yearn for a unifying force, and Rome shall answer their call."
 ser_dethrone_title:0 "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 ser_dethrone_desc:0 "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."
 ser_alpine_title:0 "March Across the Alps"
 ser_alpine_desc:0 "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a prosperous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."
 ser_rhine_title:0 "The Rhenish Border"
 ser_rhine_desc:0 "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."
 ser_belgica_title:0 "Roman Belgica"
 ser_belgica_desc:0 "The ancient homeland of the Belgae people has flourished in modern times, largely due to Dutch merchants.

 ser_fortify_rhine_title:0 "Fortify Rhine"
 ser_fortify_rhine_desc:0 "History teaches us the perils of losing an empire due to insufficient fortification. This time, we will not falter. By bolstering our defenses and constructing more forts along the border, the Rhine will become the German Graveyard should they dare to cross it again."
 ser_germany_title:0 "Conquer Germany"
 ser_germany_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, a mockery of true civilization, stands as a festering wound upon the legacy of Charlemagne's true Catholic realm. Corrupted by sin and vice, it masquerades as a bastion of Christian virtue while bowing to the Antichrist in its heart. Such a blasphemous entity cannot be suffered to exist any longer. It must be torn asunder, purged from the earth, no matter the price to be paid."
 ser_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 ser_restoration_desc:0 "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."

 ser_europe_desc:0 "The opportunity to unify Europa under Roman banners has arrived. With the mighty Rus by our side, all of Europe will finally be united under one faith, one culture, one empire.

 ser_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 ser_odyssey_desc:0 "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decreed that Romans are the rightful conquerors of both land and sea. Henceforth, our colonists shall extend our reach to every corner of the globe."
 ser_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"
 ser_punics_desc:0 "The Punics may have eluded their fate once, employing trickeries to survive. But they will not escape our wrath again. Every last one of them shall be exterminated from the world. Neither Hannibal nor any god shall save them this time!"
 ser_cities_byzantine_title:0 "Byzantine Great Cities"

 ser_cities_latin_title:0 "Latin Metropolises"
 ser_cities_latin_desc:0 "To govern the Western half of our empire more efficiently, we must establish a system of Latin Metropolises.

 ser_nomos_title:0 "Nomos Empsychos"

 ser_library_title:0 "The Great Library"
 ser_library_desc:0 "The Great Library of Alexandria, once the world's greatest repository of knowledge, hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts from across the known world, accumulated over millennia. Unfortunately, it was destroyed multiple times by fires and conquerors who disregarded its valuable contents. It's time to rebuild this unparalleled source of knowledge."
 ser_wall_title:0 "Theodosian Walls"
 ser_wall_desc:0 "The Theodosian Walls have stood as the bulwark of Constantinople for centuries, repelling countless sieges and safeguarding the heart of our empire. As the city of Constantinople expands and flourishes, it is imperative that we extend and renovate these legendary fortifications to ensure the continued protection of our capital from any would-be aggressors."
 ser_desire_title:0 "City of the World's Desire"
 ser_desire_desc:0 "Constantinople, the jewel of the empire, has weathered storms of war and turmoil, yet its splendor remains unmatched. With the resurgence of imperial power, we have the opportunity to transform this city into the pinnacle of human achievement, a beacon of culture, commerce, and innovation that will dazzle the world for generations to come."

Through our centralized efforts, we have elevated it to unprecedented heights of grandeur and opulence, surpassing even the mightiest metropolises of the world in magnificence and influence."
 ser_megalopolis_title:0 "The Megalopolis"
 ser_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Constantinople Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 ser_gigalopolis_title:0 "The Gigalopolis"
 ser_gigalopolis_desc:0 "Constantinople has grown larger than any city the world has ever seen. To sustain the vast population of the Imperial Capital, our Grand Architect has presented a grand plan: renovating [316.GetName] to become part of our Imperial City. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was highly impressed by this proposal and has officially named it the Greater Constantinople Area."
 ser_ecumenopolis_title:0 "The Ecumenopolis"
 ser_ecumenopolis_desc:0 "Ecumenopolis, a concept originating from Greek city planning, envisions a planetwide city where megalopolises merge into a single continuous urban area. With the entirety of the world now under Roman rule, this theory is poised to become a reality. Our Imperial City shall be hailed as the Caput Mundi—the Head of The World."
 ser_persia_title:0 "Conquest of Persia"
 ser_persia_desc:0 "As victors of the Persian War, we hold the right to assert our dominance over all Iranian territories.

 ser_persosphere_title:0 "Persian Administration"
 ser_persosphere_desc:0 "Despite their defeat, the Persians possess a wealth of knowledge in governance and administration accumulated over millennia.

The Persian people deserve recognition as one of the prominent cultural influences within the Roman Empire, alongside Latin and Greek."
 ser_ariana_title:0 "Secure Ariana"
 ser_ariana_desc:0 "India lies within our reach, yet it remains beyond our grasp. Formidable mountains obstruct our path, presenting a challenge to our advancing armies. As we acclimate to the terrain of Persia, we must fortify our military bases in the mountainous region of Ariana. These strategic strongholds will serve as crucial staging points for our grand invasion of India."
 ser_turkmen_title:0 "Romanize the Steppes"
 ser_turkmen_desc:0 "The southern expanse of the steppe has succumbed to our dominion and order. However, our nobility contemplates further expansion. By assimilating additional tribes into our hegemony and integrating strategically vital territories, we could potentially establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. Incorporating these lands into the territory of the Grand Diocese would not only civilize these barbarians but also consolidate our sole authority over them."
 ser_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 ser_georgia_desc:0 "Throughout the annals of history, Georgia has stood as a pivotal battleground for our forebears. Over the eons, the rugged terrain of Georgia, Armenia, and the Caucasus Mountains has witnessed the clash of Roman, Persian, and mercenary forces, each leaving their mark upon the ancient, weathered valleys.

This conquest promises to open new avenues of opportunity and strengthen our foothold in the subcontinent."
 ser_maharajas_title:0 "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ser_maharajas_desc:0 "The title of Maharaja was once reserved for the rulers of mighty Indian empires, commanding respect and authority. However, in the current state of affairs, every minor Indian king lays claim to this prestigious title, diluting its significance. We shall demonstrate to these pretenders that they pale in comparison to the might of the Roman legions."
 ser_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"

 ser_burma_desc:0 "Burma stands as the gateway to the East Indies—a vast subcontinent holding infinite wealth. Its strategic position, nestled among mountain ranges and with access to the Malayan Sea, makes it a valuable base for both our Imperial Army and Navy.

 ser_invade_china_title:0 "Invade China"
 ser_invade_china_desc:0 "China is a vast landmass with a large population and abundant resources. It would be folly not to put these resources to good use—starting with the conquest of China itself.

 ser_china_desc:0 "To establish our authority as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of China and earn the respect of the region, we must bring the heart of the Sinosphere under our control through the conquest of the entire subcontinent.

 ser_mongolia_title:0 "Subjugate the Mongols"
 ser_mongolia_desc:0 "The vast northern steppes of Mongolia are scattered with petty chiefdoms of the Mongols. Yet, one should not underestimate them, for from these very steppes, many great empires have arisen centuries ago. Now, with the Mongols weakened, it presents a favorable opportunity to subjugate them once and for all, and to incorporate their legendary cavalry tactics into the Imperial Army."
 ser_far_east_title:0 "Conqueror of Far East"
 ser_far_east_desc:0 "The rival kingdoms of Korea and Japan have waged war over the Korean Peninsula for far too long. It is evident that we must intervene decisively to put an end to their conflict and restore peace and stability to the region.

However, this debate will soon be put to rest as we stand on the brink of a historic achievement: the unification of both continents under our banner. With our imminent conquest of Asia, Rome will transcend its European origins and rightfully claim its place among the legendary Asian empires of antiquity."

If we were to exert control over this entire region, the potential benefits are immeasurable. By redirecting all trade routes into the Aegean Sea, we can reestablish the Mediterranean as a Greek sea once more, enhancing our influence and prosperity."
 nicene_hercules_title:0 "Pillars of Hercules"
 nicene_hercules_desc:0 "The Pillars of Hercules stand as the mountains flanking both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, marking the westernmost extent of Ancient Greek knowledge. Beyond them lies the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean, teeming with countless opportunities for those brave enough to navigate its waters. Now is the moment when our ambition is truly put to the test!"
 nicene_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 nicene_odyssey_desc:0 "With the Maghreb under our dominion, we have gained access to the vast Atlantic Ocean. Throughout history, ancient thinkers and cartographers spoke of mysterious lands lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Now, in recent times, we have come to understand that a new world indeed awaits us across the Atlantic. It is a land where we can send troublesome foreign adversaries, ambitious explorers, and resilient settlers by the thousands to establish a new Hellas beyond the Atlantic - Elysia. A new epic journey beckons the bravest of Greek souls."
 nicene_newworld_base_title:0 "New World Base"
 nicene_newworld_base_desc:0 "After extensive exploration to the West, we have made a startling discovery: the Punics, thought to have been vanquished, have managed to escape their demise by fleeing to the New World! This poses a significant threat to our interests and stability in the region. We must make preparations for the inevitable conflict that lies ahead."
 nicene_punics_title:0 "Exterminate Punics"
 nicene_punics_desc:0 "Though the Punics may have once been our allies against Rome in the distant past, centuries have since passed, and they now stand as a barrier to our ambition of establishing the Elysian nation in North America. No Hannibal nor gods shall save them this time! We must act decisively to remove this obstacle and secure our foothold in the New World."
