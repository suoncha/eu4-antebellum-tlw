# Punic League
 string_start_title_punic: "The Punic League"
 string_start_punic: "The Punic League is a resilient coalition of city-states, born from the ashes of ancient §YCarthage§! after the §YSecond Punic War§!. Led by the indomitable §YHannibal Barca§!, the Punics fled across the Atlantic, establishing a new realm on the distant shores of §YBuniq§!. Over the centuries, the League's cities flourished, maintaining a delicate balance of power under the guidance of the §YEasima§!, who serves as both spiritual leader and political mediator. However, this unity is fragile, tested by internal strife and the looming threat of distant memories.\n\nAt its heart lies §YTanit§!, the de jure capital, where the city of §YHannibal§!, named after the legendary general, houses the grand temple of §YBaal Hammon§!. This is the sacred center of the League, a symbol of unity and the divine favor that has guided them through the centuries. Nearby, §YUtica§! guards the §YSacred Grove of Eshmun§!, a site of pilgrimage and spiritual strength for all Punics. Further south, §YShabratan§! stands as the bastion of §YMelqart§!, with its grand shrine dedicated to the god who watches over their victories. §YHadrumetum§!, known as the League's intellectual hub, fosters knowledge and innovation, ensuring the Punic people remain at the forefront of learning. Meanwhile, §YThapsus§!, with its rich fishing grounds, feeds the League, providing the bounty of the seas to sustain its cities. In the rugged lands of §YIscina§!, the iron mines work tirelessly, arming the League's warriors with the weapons needed to defend their homes. §YMeninx§!, ever the hub of commerce, thrives on the trade of slaves, fueling the economy that supports their dominion. §YUbon§!, deep in the heartlands, cultivates tobacco, its fields feeding a lucrative trade network, while the city itself remains enshrouded in the secrets of the §YMuskogean Crime Syndicate§!. §YCartenna§!, the League's southern frontier, ensures a steady supply of cotton, vital for the growing textile industry that clothes the Punic populace. But this prosperity has not come without challenges. Rivalries between the cities often flare up, and the ambitions of the §YEumdas§!, the powerful consuls who govern these cities, threaten the delicate equilibrium. The §YRayis§!, the chieftains of the Punicized native tribes of Aldiraq, add another layer of complexity, their loyalty split between their own ambition and the League's authority.\n\nAs the §Y15th Century§! unfolds, the League faces growing pressure from the European powers who have begun to explore and colonize the §YNew World§!. They have already set their hungry eyes towards the rich lands of Buniq. The Punic League, though far from the §YOld World§!, cannot ignore the encroaching tide. The Easima, aware of the gathering storm, must rally the League's cities and fortify their defenses, lest they fall victim to the same fate as Carthage.\n\nNow, on the eve of a new era, the Punic League stands at a crossroads. Will the Easima unify the cities and repel the foreign invaders, or will the League's legacy be lost to the relentless march of history? The fate of Buniq and the dream of Carthage's restoration hang in the balance."

 string_start_title_barbiri: "Legacy of Two Worlds"
 string_start_barbiri: "Since the §YPunics§! first landed on the shores of §YBuniq§!, they forged alliances and shared their traditions with the native peoples of the land, leading to the rise of the §YAldiraqs§!: territories governed by §YPunicized American§! tribes who have grown within the League's structure, yet have developed distinct identities of their own. These Aldiraqs have deepened their spiritual practices over time, incorporating powerful foreign philosophies and religions introduced by §YHannibal§!'s legendary advisors. But now, as the League confronts external threats and internal strife, these Aldiraqs sense their potential long-held in check by Punic rule.\n\nOne by one, they are beginning to consider a different future - one of autonomy, where their people may forge a true identity without the Punic influence and pursue a legacy beyond the League. For each, the bonds they have fostered outside the League may prove essential in guiding their vision.\n\nIn the north, §YDylamea§!'s adherence to §YHellenism§! has flourished under the legacy of §YSosylus of Sparta§!, Hannibal's faithful advisor. With their roots Punicized yet distinct, the Dylameans have looked to the nearby §YHylinian League§!, finding shared ideals in its Hellenic traditions and complex federations. The guiding influence of the League fuels their drive to foster a future unbound by Punic control, aspiring to embody the rich Hellenic values in governance and culture.\n\n§YBuhutan§!, bearing the flame of §YZoroastrianism§!, owes its spiritual foundation to §YMolon of Media§!. A guardian of these teachings, Molon planted the seeds of Zoroastrianism, which the people of Buhutan have nurtured in earnest. Their faith has only deepened through their alliance with the §YOrder of Zoroaster§!, a coalition forged by Zoroastrian-converted Iroquoians in the Great Lakes. From these allies, Buhutan has adopted both martial and spiritual ideals, envisioning an independent rule, guided by the light of Zoroaster's wisdom.\n\n§YKataqart§!, followers of §YJudaism§!, finds its faith rooted in the teachings of §YRehob of Yerushalayim§!, Hannibal's companion from the §YHoly City§!. As time passed, this belief drew Kataqart into a lasting friendship with the mighty §YCahokian Empire§!, another beacon of Jewish faith on the continent. In their shared beliefs, Kataqart has learned the power of unity and survival, and as they observe the Cahokians' strength, they too consider a future free from the Punic League, where their people might fully embrace their unique heritage.\n\nNow, with the winds of change blowing through Buniq, the Aldiraqs stand at a pivotal moment. Will they seize the chance to break free, honoring their Punic lineage yet carving a new path rooted in their faiths and alliances? Or will they remain bound to the League, their aspirations forever tied to the dreams of Carthage?"
