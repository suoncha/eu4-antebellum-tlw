 string_start_punic: "The Punic League is a resilient coalition of city-states, born from the ashes of ancient §YCarthage§! after the §YSecond Punic War§!. Led by the indomitable §YHannibal Barca§!, the Punics fled across the Atlantic, establishing a new realm on the distant shores of §YBuniq§!. Over the centuries, the League's cities flourished, maintaining a delicate balance of power under the guidance of the §YEasima§!, who serves as both spiritual leader and political mediator. However, this unity is fragile, tested by internal strife and the looming threat of distant memories.\n\nAt its heart lies §YTanit§!, the de jure capital, where the city of §YHannibal§!, named after the legendary general, houses the grand temple of §YBaal Hammon§!. This is the sacred center of the League, a symbol of unity and the divine favor that has guided them through the centuries. Nearby, §YUtica§! guards the §YSacred Grove of Eshmun§!, a site of pilgrimage and spiritual strength for all Punics. Further south, §YShabratan§! stands as the bastion of §YMelqart§!, with its grand shrine dedicated to the god who watches over their victories. §YHadrumetum§!, known as the League's intellectual hub, fosters knowledge and innovation, ensuring the Punic people remain at the forefront of learning. Meanwhile, §YThapsus§!, with its rich fishing grounds, feeds the League, providing the bounty of the seas to sustain its cities. In the rugged lands of §YIscina§!, the iron mines work tirelessly, arming the League's warriors with the weapons needed to defend their homes. §YMeninx§!, ever the hub of commerce, thrives on the trade of slaves, fueling the economy that supports their dominion. §YUbon§!, deep in the heartlands, cultivates tobacco, its fields feeding a lucrative trade network, while the city itself remains enshrouded in the secrets of the §YMuskogean Crime Syndicate§!. §YCartenna§!, the League's southern frontier, ensures a steady supply of cotton, vital for the growing textile industry that clothes the Punic populace. But this prosperity has not come without challenges. Rivalries between the cities often flare up, and the ambitions of the §YEumdas§!, the powerful consuls who govern these cities, threaten the delicate equilibrium. The §YRayis§!, the chieftains of the Punicized native tribes of Aldiraq, add another layer of complexity, their loyalty split between their own ambition and the League's authority.\n\nAs the §Y15th Century§! unfolds, the League faces growing pressure from the European powers who have begun to explore and colonize the §YNew World§!. They have already set their hungry eyes towards the rich lands of Buniq. The Punic League, though far from the §YOld World§!, cannot ignore the encroaching tide. The Easima, aware of the gathering storm, must rally the League's cities and fortify their defenses, lest they fall victim to the same fate as Carthage.\n\nNow, on the eve of a new era, the Punic League stands at a crossroads. Will the Easima unify the cities and repel the foreign invaders, or will the League's legacy be lost to the relentless march of history? The fate of Buniq and the dream of Carthage's restoration hang in the balance."
