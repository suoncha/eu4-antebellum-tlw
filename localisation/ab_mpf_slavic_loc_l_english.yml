ab_mpf_slavic.1.t: "Jarilo Festival"
ab_mpf_slavic.1.d: "Jarilo, god of fertility and the spring, was born on the last night of February, Velja Noc, as the tenth son of Perun, the great god of thunder. On that same night, he was stolen across the sea to the underworld by Veles, Perun's archenemy, and raised there to guard his livestock. When Jarilo returned to the mortal world, he brought the springtime with him, and this we celebrate every year with a festival in his honour."
ab_mpf_slavic.1.a: "Gdje Jarilo hodit, tam vam polje rodit."

ab_mpf_slavic.2.t: "Perun's Lightning!"
ab_mpf_slavic.2.d: "It would seem our efforts in the current war against the heathens have not gone unnoticed by Perun; word has reached us that in a recent battle, their forces were beset by bolts of lightning from the sky! The spirit of our soldiers has been greatly bolstered by this clear show of favour."
ab_mpf_slavic.2.a: "Perun's wrath strikes our foe!"
