 canaanite_religion_desc:0 "Canaanite refers to the different polytheistic practices of the Semitics from what is the ancient Levant and though the religion and it's pantheon was similar across the different peoples of the Levant there were still regional differences and specially between different ethnic groups, so this is more of a generalized agrupation. For example, Baal is known as a common deity across Semites from Syria and Phoenicia, however, this is just a title meaning 'Lord' which is shared by different deities which shared similar aspects, the gods Hadad and Hammon (Aramean and Phoenician respectively) share this title. For the Semites in what is the South Levant; Israel, Judah, Moab, Ammon and Edom, their commonality was a chief deity that overshadowed all the others, with the Israelites taking it a step further and founding proper Monotheism."
