#Byzantium/Rome
 ab_byzantium.47.t:0 "Belisarius Reborn"
 ab_byzantium.47.d:0 "Belisarius, a formidable commander of the Byzantine Empire during Justinian's reign, played a crucial role in reclaiming lost Mediterranean territories from the Western Empire. Despite resource constraints, he earned the esteemed title 'Last of the Romans' for his remarkable feats such as conquering the Vandals in nine months and securing much of Italy during the Gothic War, including the recapture of Rome. Now, with our invincible army poised for further conquests, a standout general is required to lead them. Among our Strategos Office ranks, one individual stands out. Despite humble origins, his exceptional talents have propelled him to greatness, earning him comparisons to the legendary Belisarius. He is the natural choice to inherit the mantle of leadership."
 ab_byzantium.47.a:0 "The Strategos Office shall follow his guidance"

 ab_byzantium.48.t:0 "Byzantine Military Reforms"
 ab_byzantium.48.d:0 "The once formidable Roman Army, renowned across the world, has seen its glory fade in the wake of devastating wars and military failures. As our adversaries advance, we find ourselves diminished, unable to rely solely on past achievements. It's imperative that we adapt to the evolving battlefield. Our first step is the re-militarization of our citizenry, forging them into a formidable force capable of defending our empire."
 ab_byzantium.48.a:0 "Let us restart the age of Roman expansion"

 ab_byzantium.49.t:0 "Hellenization of the Bulgars"
 ab_byzantium.49.d:0 "For centuries, the Bulgars have been a relentless adversary, contributing to our empire's decline and suffering. Yet, fate has shifted in our favor, granting us dominion over their lands. Now, as masters of their territory, we must act decisively. We shall drive them back to the Volga, expelling their menace from our borders. Those who choose to remain shall be assimilated, embracing the customs of their new lords."
 ab_byzantium.49.a:0 "We hold the legitimate claim as the sovereigns of the Balkans"

 ab_byzantium.50.t:0 "Hellenization of the Balkans"
 ab_byzantium.50.d:0 "During the reign of Justinian, the Balkans were inhabited by Romanized and Hellenized Illyrian people, which was the homeland of great Roman emperors such as Aurelian, Constantine, Valentinianus, and even Justinian himself. However, the devastating Justinian Plague ravaged the region, leaving destruction in its wake. With the subsequent migration of the Slavs, Illyria experienced a resurgence in population and vitality.\n\nOver the years, the Slavic people of the Balkans have attempted to adopt Christianity and embrace aspects of our Roman way of life. With the recent reconquest of the Balkans, it is time to restore this region to its former glory. Let us integrate the locals and impart upon them the virtues of Roman civilization."
 ab_byzantium.50.a:0 "Illyria will thrive once again"

 ab_byzantium.51.t:0 "Nicaean Invasion"
 ab_byzantium.51.d:0 "The traitorous Nicaeans have declared war on us! While not entirely unexpected, we cannot afford to lose this conflict. Their insolence has gone unchecked for far too long. It is time to reclaim what is ours and put an end to their defiance once and for all!"
 ab_byzantium.51.a:0 "Down with the Stratocracy!"

 ab_byzantium.52.t:0 "Occupation of [NCI.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.52.d:0 "After months of relentless conflict, we have dealt a decisive blow to the pretender Kingdom of Nicaea. With the capture of [NCI.Capital.GetName], their hopes for victory have been shattered. Rejoice! The western coast of Anatolia is now firmly back under our control."
 ab_byzantium.52.a:0 "Peace, at last"

 ab_byzantium.53.t:0 "Bulgarian Invasion"
 ab_byzantium.53.d:0 "Your Majesty! Reports indicate that Bulgaria has resumed our conflict. We must consider a swift siege of their capital to weaken their resolve and potentially force them into negotiations for peace."
 ab_byzantium.53.a:0 "We will reach [BUL.Capital.GetName] in months!"

 ab_byzantium.54.t:0 "Occupation of [BUL.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.54.d:0 "After months of relentless conflict, victory is ours! The Kingdom of Bulgaria has capitulated, their once-proud capital now under our mercy. [BUL.Monarch.GetName] has been forced to concede, relinquishing our rightful territories and offering reparations. Cheers, for Greece is now united!"
 ab_byzantium.54.a:0 "Macedonia is just the beginning of our military campaigns"

 ab_byzantium.57.t:0 "Italian Ambition"
 ab_byzantium.57.d:0 "With the annexation of Albania, the Strait of Otranto stands as the final barrier between us and the Roman heartland - Italia. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has deemed this the opportune moment to launch an assault across the sea and reclaim the peninsula."
 ab_byzantium.57.a:0 "Italia shall be reconquered"

 ab_byzantium.58.t:0 "Integration of the Romanians"
 ab_byzantium.58.d:0 "After the restoration of [Root.GetName], Carpathia was integrated as an administrative region within Diocese Dacia. This presents an opportunity to incorporate our former Romanian subjects into the territory of the new Diocese."
 ab_byzantium.58.a:0 "Certainly"
 ab_byzantium.58.b:0 "I will keep them around for a while"

 ab_byzantium.59.t:0 "Diocese System"
 ab_byzantium.59.d:0 "Rome - a vast nation, is far too stretched to be governed effiently from the Central Government. Thus, Roman Diocese, the regional governance district made up of a grouping of provinces each headed by an elected Vicarius, was created in the Late Empire era to address this problem. The Vicars are tasked with overseeing their Dioceses, affording them a semblance of autonomy within the broader empire. This unique status grants them several special features:\n- Each Diocese grants us §G1§! Merchant and §YMonthly Influence§! of a specific §YCultural Sphere§!\n- Developing Diocese provinces changes §YInfluence§! of our §YCultural Spheres§!. But they cannot develop provinces on their own\n- Dioceses have access to §GRomanization§! mechanic\n- Dioceses do not take our diplomatic slot and only count their own relative power for liberty desire\n- Dioceses will not join our wars automatically. We have to pay §R25§! to §R50§! favors to call them in and it would displease them by doing so\n- Dioceses pay higher tax, manpower, forcelimit and trade power to us than normal subjects\n- Dioceses can only be annexed if all of their provinces are §GRomanized§!\n- Dioceses have modifiers for both §RUnromanized§! and §GRomanized§! provinces\n- Dioceses can only be created, transfered provinces through §YDiocese Management§! menu, which can be accessed by a side button in the §YDecision Tab§!\n- Dioceses can trigger flavor events"
 ab_byzantium.59.a:0 "Understood"

 ab_byzantium.60.t:0 "Conqueror of the Seven Seas"
 ab_byzantium.60.d:0 "In the annals of Roman history, there exists a tale as audacious as it is absurd. In the first century, Caligula the lunatic emperor, driven by his insatiable thirst for conquest, embarked on a campaign to Britain. Yet, the fates conspired against him, for the journey barely reached the shores of Gaul before it was unceremoniously halted.\n\nBut returning to Rome without the laurels of victory was inconceivable for Caligula. In a fit of madness, he declared war not on mortal foes, but on Neptune himself, god of the sea. With hubris unmatched, he commanded his legions to whip the waves into submission. Seashells, humble treasures of the shore, were hailed as spoils of this bizarre conflict.\n\nThough history may mock his folly, the legacy of Caligula's expedition endures. Today, Rome has conquered every corner of the globe. Even the vast expanse of the Seven Seas was not beyond the reach of Roman ambition, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Eternal City."
 ab_byzantium.60.a:0 "The true Mare Nostrum"

 ab_byzantium.61.t:0 "Punics in the New World"
 ab_byzantium.61.d:0 "This is astonishing! As our brave explorers set foot on the shores of the distant land across the Atlantic Ocean, they were met with a sight unlike anything they had ever imagined. Bustling ports teeming with people from diverse cultures and religions, rivaling even our most prosperous cities. Initially, there was a fleeting thought that perhaps our preconceived notions of barbarism were mistaken, but the truth soon emerged - there were no barbarians but the Punics.\n\nBy trading with locals, we learned that the cunning Hannibal had sought refuge on this distant continent during the Antiquity, bringing with him thousands of Punics right under our noses to avoid the demise of their civilization causing by our ancestors's wrath.\n\nAlthough many centuries have passed, these Punics have not forgotten their rivalry with the Romans. Unfortunately, some of our explorers have been recognized as their ancient enemy which proved to be a grave mistake. Some were captured, while others managed to evade capture and return with this shocking news. Rome has some cities to burn."
 ab_byzantium.61.a:0 "Are they looking for another Punic War? Then so shall they have it!"

 ab_byzantium.62.t:0 "Unification of the Orthodox World"
 ab_byzantium.62.d:0 "The Russian people have long suffered under the yoke of the Tatars and internal strife, while we, bound by circumstance, could offer little aid. With the healing of the Schism, many bishops in Rus still not acknowledge our authority, instead proclaimed their own Autocephaly that are separated from the Patriarch in Constantinople. The path is now clear for us to unite all the First, Second, and Third Rome. Let us not squander this historic moment. Mother Rus, your sons and daughters will soon join the ranks of Roman subjects."
 ab_byzantium.62.a:0 "We shall unite the princes in the name of Rus!"
 ab_byzantium.62.b:0 "We shall become the Tsar of Rus!"

 ab_byzantium.63.t:0 "Roman Belgica"
 ab_byzantium.63.d:0 "Belgica - the Lands Between, historically linked with Gallia in the annals of antiquity, yet its cultural tapestry weaves a different tale. The local Dutch populace, being closer in kinship to their German neighbors than the Gallian French, complicates matters even further. As we contemplate integration of Belgica into an adjacent Diocese, the question looms large: to which region shall Belgica belong? The answer remains elusive, shrouded in the fog of history and the nuances of identity."
 ab_byzantium.63.a:0 "Belgica is an integral part of Gallia"
 ab_byzantium.63.b:0 "Belgica is an integral part of Germania"

 ab_byzantium.64.t:0 "Rulers of Europe"
 ab_byzantium.64.d:0 "Emerging from the ruins, from the ravages of war and conflict by countless foes - from the Huns to the Persians, from the Arabs to the Crusaders, from treachery and invasion threats - Rome has withstood the test of time. Despite facing threats from all directions, our resilience has prevailed. We have not only defended our borders but reclaimed lands thought lost forever.\n\nToday marks a historic triumph as the Roman people extend their dominion over all of Europe. This achievement surpasses the wildest ambitions of our predecessors. Citizens of Rome, celebrate! The Light of Rome shines brighter than ever before, and no force can extinguish it!"
 ab_byzantium.64.a:0 "Finally, we have achieved Pax Romana!"

 ab_byzantium.65.t:0 "Romanization of Rus"
 ab_byzantium.65.d:0 "After a century under Roman dominion, the cultural landscape of Rus has undergone profound transformation. Initially, it was the East Slavic nobility who embraced Roman language, customs and traditions, a trend that gradually permeated through all strata of society over time. Presently, the majority of Slavic people converses in an East Slavic variant of Roman, forsaking their native tongue. Moreover, a notable shift in identity is observed as they reject the labels of Russian or Ruthenian, opting instead for the designation of Ruthenicus."
 ab_byzantium.65.a:0 "And then the Roman culture expanded"

 ab_byzantium.67.t:0 "Restoration of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.67.d:0 "We have eclipsed Justinian's achievements and other pretenders by restoring the true Rome, stretching from Iberia to the Levant. Despite being powerful as we are now, the empire comes with unique mechanics that demand careful management.\n\nFirstly, the §GRomanization§! mechanic will automatically convert our owned provinces to the §YRoman§! culture group. This process can be sped up through various means, detailed in the '§YRomanization Info§!' icon in the §YDecisions Tab§!.\n\nSecondly, the §GCultural Sphere§! government reform introduces two initial factions - Latins and Greeks - with two more can be §Gunlocked§! through missions. Balancing favor between them is crucial to avoid triggering the §RBiased Cultural Sphere§! disaster, causing a massive revolt and breakup of the empire.\n\nNext, we have the §RPersian War§! disaster that can be triggered by bordering Persia. Completing it will §Gunlock§! more missions for eastern expansion. Note that if you started as @SRK §YSarukhanids§!, you will bypass this disaster completely.\n\nLastly, the §GDiocese§! subject type offers a new form of governance which will be explained in the following page."
 ab_byzantium.67.a:0 "What is a Diocese?"

 ab_byzantium.68.t:0 "Consul Election"
 ab_byzantium.68.d1:0 "The term is up for $MONARCH$. We must choose the next Consul from..."
 ab_byzantium.68.d2:0 "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election. We must choose the next Consul from..."
 ab_byzantium.68.a:0 "...the Latinsphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.b:0 "...the Hellenosphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.c:0 "...the Persosphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.d:0 "...the Sinosphere"

 ab_byzantium.69.t:0 "Suppressed Diocese"
 ab_byzantium.69.d:0 "The Diocese Rebellion has finally been suppressed. Now we have to decide their fate."
 ab_byzantium.69.a:0 "Reintegrated into our direct governance"
 ab_byzantium.69.b:0 "Keep them as Diocese"

 ab_byzantium.70.t:0 "Heritage Trait Gained"
 ab_byzantium.70.d:0 "You have earned a Rome Heritage modifier based on your starting nation."
 ab_byzantium.70.a:0 "Great"

 ab_byzantium.72.t:0 "General's Specialization"
 ab_byzantium.72.d:0 "Select a General's Specialization for the next 10 years."
 ab_byzantium.72.a:0 "Fire"
 ab_byzantium.72.b:0 "Shock"
 ab_byzantium.72.c:0 "Manuever"
 ab_byzantium.72.e:0 "Siege"

 ab_byzantium.73.t:0 "Maximum Imperial Professionalism Reached"
 ab_byzantium.73.d:0 "The Roman Army has become excessively centralized, making it nearly impossible to coordinate with our Dioceses."
 ab_byzantium.73.a:0 "We should further decentralize the army"

 ab_byzantium.74.t:0 "Maximum Diocese Professionalism Reached"
 ab_byzantium.74.d:0 "The Roman Army has become too decentralized, rendering our professional army useless."
 ab_byzantium.74.a:0 "We should further centralize the army"

 ab_byzantium.78.t:0 "Roman Caucasia"
 ab_byzantium.78.d:0 "Caucasia has long been the main battleground between the Roman and Persian Empires, witnessing centuries of conflict. From the lush valleys of Georgia and Armenia to the rugged mountains of the Caucasus, it has been a theater of strife, where the blood of Romans, Persians, and mercenaries alike has soaked into the ancient soil. With Persia now under our control, we must decide the path of Caucasia. Will it align with the Hellenic Anatolia or remain part of the Persian world?"
 ab_byzantium.78.a:0 "Caucasia falls within the sphere of Anatolia"
 ab_byzantium.78.b:0 "Caucasia falls within the sphere of Persia"

 ab_byzantium.79.t:0 "Reconquest of the Levant"
 ab_byzantium.79.d:0 "The Levant, once a proud possession of the Roman Empire, now lies under the dominion of the Saracens. Despite centuries of Muslim rule and resistance against numerous Crusades launched by the Catholics, the Levant remains firmly in their grasp. However, the tides of history are shifting, as our legions are poised to reclaim the lost territories in the Levant, restoring Imperial authority to these lands once more."
 ab_byzantium.79.a:0 "Our adversaries shall quake in fear before our might"

 ab_byzantium.80.t:0 "The Fall of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.80.d:0 "The fall of Rome, once the heart of Western civilization and Christendom, is a sobering blow to believers across Europe. As the flames engulf Latium and the ancient city falls under the dominion of the Turks, the very soul of Christendom trembles. [Root.Monarch.GetName] leads his forces into the Papacy, met with fleeing Christian populace and priests, their desperate prayers echoing amidst the chaos.\n\nAmidst the triumphant sounds of the Mehter and the proclamations of the conquerors, the symbols of Roman heritage yield to the banners of the Turks. From the Colosseum to the Castel Sant'Angelo, the blue standard flies, bearing witness to a new order. Across Christendom, panic ensues as news of Rome's fall spreads, prompting frantic preparations for the defense of their own homelands.\n\nYet, amidst the turmoil, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds solace in the fulfillment of ancestral aspirations. Rome now bows to Turkish rule, as the conquerors set their sights further into Europe, heralding a new chapter in history."
 ab_byzantium.80.a:0 "All of Christendom will bow to Ahura Mazda!"

 ab_byzantium.81.t:0 "Epitome of Far East"
 ab_byzantium.81.d:0 "Far East - the easternmost region of our empire, harbors two culturally rich civilizations: the Korean scholars and the Japanese warriors. Despite their distinct histories as separate kingdoms prior to Roman rule, it is prudent to unite them under one Diocese, leveraging their shared geography and cultural affinities. However, a decision must be made regarding the capital of the Diocese, a city that will inherit the legacy of both cultures. We should choose the capital of..."
 ab_byzantium.81.a:0 "...the Hermit Kingdom"
 ab_byzantium.81.b:0 "...the Chrysanthemum Throne"

 ab_byzantium.82.t:0 "An Empire Across Asia"
 ab_byzantium.82.d:0 "With the total conquest of Asia, we now stand as the largest and most diversed empire in history. Our realm stretches from [225.GetName] to [1020.GetName], from tundra to plains, from imperial metropolises to rural villages. What's more, the four major cultural spheres: Latin, Greek, Persian, and Chinese, have all been integrated into Rome, incorporating the powers and knowledge of people from around the world. This has brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to the whole Eurasia."
 ab_byzantium.82.a:0 "The greatest nation on Earth"

 ab_byzantium.83.t:0 "Capital of the Empire"
 ab_byzantium.83.d:0 "Deciding the capital of our renewed nation, encompassing the legacies of the First, Second, and Third Rome, is a monumental task. Shall we maintain [280.GetName], complementing Rome with Slavic heritage, or relocate the Imperial Throne to [151.GetName], the heart of Byzantine legacy?"
 ab_byzantium.83.a:0 "[280.GetName] will mark the new era of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.83.b:0 "[151.GetName] is the traditional capital of Rome"

 ab_byzantium.84.t:0 "Romanization of Tataria"
 ab_byzantium.84.d:0 "Tataria, once a land of scattered tribes, now undergoes a profound transformation under the banner of Romanization. The Tatar people, long known for their nomadic ways, have begun to embrace Roman culture with remarkable fervor. It started with the ruling elite, who settled and adopted Roman customs, followed by the regional governors and common folk. Though the process will take time, they aspire to be recognized as the Romans of the Steppes - Scythicus."
 ab_byzantium.84.a:0 "And then the Roman culture expanded"

 ab_byzantium.86.t:0 "Westernization of Latin Empire"
 ab_byzantium.86.d:0 "After the formation of the Latin Empire, there has been a notable departure from the Illyrian heritage that once defined our nation. Instead, we find ourselves increasingly drawn to the cultural influences of the Western world. This shift is exemplified by the adoption of Francien as the official language of the royal court, signaling a clear alignment with Western customs and traditions. As we continue on this path of Westernization, we seek to solidify our position within the broader Latinsphere and embrace the values and practices that define it."
 ab_byzantium.86.a:0 "The reformed administration will deepen our ties with the West"

 ab_byzantium.87.t:0 "Restoration of West Rome"
 ab_byzantium.87.d:0 "With the capture of Rome and many ancient Roman territories, West Rome emerges from the turmoil of wars, rallying Christians and Latin peoples under the banner of the Eternal City once more. Yet, our mission remains unfinished. To fully restore the glory of the Roman Empire, we must extend our dominion to the Eastern provinces. The Schism still divides the Christian world, which must be united in our pursuit of the true Rome's restoration.\n\nThough some may hesitate to wage war against fellow Christians, we must recognize that our cause serves the greater good of all believers and the legacy of Rome. Let the rebirth of the Roman Phoenix inspire Europe, guiding us through the shadows of uncertainty. For the glory of Christ, the grace of the Lord, and the eternal spirit of Rome!"
 ab_byzantium.87.a:0 "May the dream of Rome be realized"

 ab_byzantium.88.t:0 "Aftermath of the Crusader"
 ab_byzantium.88.d:0 "The kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia stand as the last bastions of Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula, steadfast against the encroaching shadow of the Caliphate. When the heathens first swept into Visigothic lands, many attempts at resistance were futile. Yet, from the courage of Pelagius and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias arose. Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria, expanded the realm to encompass both Galicia and Asturias, but dynastic disputes later divided them. Navarra's bid for independence, led by Inigo Arista, saw success against Carolingian invaders and Muslim overlords, leading to the rise of the Jimenez Dynasty.\n\nIn 1443, Iberia suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles fell, and northern lands were scorched by Christian raiding parties. A hasty peace between the Franks and Umayyads only temporarily halted the threat of famine and renewed offensive on the frontline. Yet, for the Iberian crusaders, this peace felt like betrayal, shaking their faith and casting uncertainty on the future of the peninsula."
 ab_byzantium.88.a:0 "We must unite the Christians at once before Andalusia can retaliate"

 ab_byzantium.89.t:0 "Future of Iberia"
 ab_byzantium.89.d:0 "The Reconquista marks a triumphant return of many major cities in Hispania to Christian control. The support of Galicians, Asturians, Basques, and other Iberians from the South was pivotal in this success, shifting our nation's demographics and aspirations. From [227.GetName] to [213.GetName], a call for this union resonates. Some advocate for a new path, venturing westward for fortune and securing Christ's legacy in the unknown lands. Others long to reclaim our Visigothic roots in the east, aspiring to restore the glory of the fallen Western Empire of Rome."
 ab_byzantium.89.a:0 "We will forge a new nation for the Iberian people"
 ab_byzantium.89.b:0 "We will claim the legacy of Rome"

 ab_byzantium.90.t:0 "Iberian Reconquista"
 ab_byzantium.90.d:0 "Our Iberian brethren have launched a Reconquista to expel the Muslims from Hispania. With our support, their success seems inevitable."
 ab_byzantium.90.a:0 "Mobilize the army! We shall aid our fellow Christians in their righteous cause"
 ab_byzantium.90.b:0 "This matter does not concerns us"

 ab_byzantium.91.t:0 "Francian Support"
 ab_byzantium.91.d:0 "The Emperor pledges support in our war against Andalusia."
 ab_byzantium.91.a:0 "For Christianity!"

 ab_byzantium.92.t:0 "Timed Mission Unlocked"
 ab_byzantium.92.d:0 "We have unlocked the 'The Italian League' timed mission. If we complete this mission within 5 years after being at war with the Italian League, we will unlock a powerful reward. Should we fail, the mission will be §Rpermanently removed§! from our mission tree."
 ab_byzantium.92.a:0 "Understood"

 ab_byzantium.93.t:0 "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_byzantium.93.d:0 "We have failed to complete the 'The Italian League' timed mission, therefore the mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_byzantium.93.a:0 "Unfortunate"

 ab_byzantium.94.t:0 "Establishing Diocese"
 ab_byzantium.94.d:0 "Due to our recent success in military campaign, a new Diocese has been established in the conquered territories. This will help us greatly in stablizing and Romanizing the region."
 ab_byzantium.94.a:0 "Good to hear that"

 ab_byzantium.97.t:0 "Jerusalem in Christian Hands"
 ab_byzantium.97.d:0 "The Holy City of Jerusalem, arguably Christianity's most important city bar Rome, is now under Christian rule. As the seat of the Kings of Jerusalem since the First Crusade, the constant threat of Islamic takeovers haven't harmed the population of this fortress-city as they did with other regions of the Holy Land, at least as significantly. With our nation's banners flying from the walls and a large boost to morale, it will only be a matter of time until the rest of the Near East returns to the Christian fold. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], with the Pope's blessing, has promised to continue the reconquest of former Christian lands until not a single heathen holds rule over the Old World, much to the fanfare of the Catholics. It seems that peace won't return to the region for some time, though many are holding onto hope for us to change this perpetually."
 ab_byzantium.97.a:0 "The cross is triumphant once more!"

 ab_byzantium.98.t:0 "The Fate of Córdoba"
 ab_byzantium.98.d:0 "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! We have succeeded in driving out the infidels out of the city of [225.GetName]! Our forces are patrolling the city as we speak, although, the question remains. What of the city? We have been presented with two main options. One being that we simply sack the city, save for the grand mosque which we plan on converting to a holy cathedral, important relics and libraries. Another option is to leave the city in peace and perhaps make it our capital, what would be more fitting then if we make the capital of the infidel our own? It would certainly endear us to the local populace and perhaps they may be more willing to convert to the holy faith! The choice is your my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ab_byzantium.98.a:0 "Let the soldiers plunder the city"
 ab_byzantium.98.b:0 "[225.GetName] shall become our new capital"

 ab_byzantium.99.t:0 "Lucius Artorius Castus"
 ab_byzantium.99.d:0 "Askeladd, born Lucius Artorius Castus, has finally witnessed the realization of his lifelong dream with our conquest of Denmark. The downfall of the Danish oppressors has brought a sense of fulfillment to the once cunning and ruthless Viking leader, whose life was marked by a complex struggle between his Danish and Welsh heritage.\n\nRaised by his Welsh mother on tales of the grandeur of the Brittonic legacy and the tyranny of the Danes, Askeladd's path was one of vengeance and ambition. Through a journey of deceit, strategy, and unyielding will, he played a pivotal role in weakening Danish power from within. Now, with Denmark under Brittonic rule, his vision has been achieved.\n\nIn this newfound era, Askeladd pledges unwavering loyalty to our court. His strategic mind, honed through years of conflict and survival, is now at our disposal. He stands ready to serve, driven by a desire to honor his mother's wishes and to secure the future of his people under our reign. His legacy, once forged in vengeance, now transforms into one of service and devotion, promising to be a cornerstone of our rule in these newly conquered lands."
 ab_byzantium.99.a:0 "The man can use his experience of combat to serve the court"
 ab_byzantium.99.b:0 "The man can use his experience of combat to lead our army"
 ab_byzantium.99.c:0 "Such a man cannot be bound to servitude! How about exploring the new lands for us?"

 ab_byzantium.100.t:0 "The Third Rome"
 ab_byzantium.100.d:0 "Our soldiers parade into the newly christened city of [151.GetName], formerly Constantinople, in celebration of the heroic victories that have led to this moment. With this new conquest, [Root.GetName] will be seen in the eyes of the world as the true Third Rome!\n\nAll that remains is to decide on the capital of our renewed nation; shall it remain in the great city of [Root.Capital.GetName], or shall we relocate the court to [151.GetName]?"
 ab_byzantium.100.a:0 "[151.GetName] shall be our capital!"
 ab_byzantium.100.b:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] shall be made even more glorious!"

However, despite our rightful claim as the successors of Rome, the West still views us as merely the Empire of the Greeks. To rectify this perception, the bureaucracy must undergo reforms that blend both Latin and Greek values.\n\nYet, as plans for this overhaul unfold, an unforeseen catastrophe strikes.

Peasants, Muslims, and Italians alike found themselves unable to halt the inexorable march of Roman resilience.\n\nYet, amidst this respite, a daunting challenge remains.

Yet, the prospect of reclaiming the Western Empire presents a tantalizing opportunity to revive Latin as the language of unity.\n\nHowever, such a move may stir discontent among the [Root.GetNobilityName], who have long embraced Greek as their own. To navigate this delicate balance, we must consider a compromise that accommodates both languages, fostering harmony and inclusivity within our united Roman Empire.\n\nWhat will it be, my liege?

 ab_byzantium_disaster.71.d:0 "The Roman Empire stood unparalleled in history. From the northern reaches of Britain to the deserts of the Sahara, and from the shores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Euphrates, it enforced peace and prosperity on an unprecedented scale. Its sole rival lay in the East, where the Parthians and later the Sassanids presided over great cities and trade routes to enigmatic lands beyond. This was the realm Alexander the Great had traversed, igniting a vision of glory and conquest that captivated Greeks and Romans alike. The legendary rivalry between the ancient world's two superpowers is etched into the annals of history.\n\nNow, as our empire rises from the ashes, so too do the Persians, particularly following our conquest of their ancient capital, Ctesiphon. Tensions mount along our shared border, evoking memories of the Roman-Persian Wars that spanned centuries. The drain on resources during these protracted conflicts proved calamitous for both empires, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable. Seizing advantage of our weakened state, the Rashidun armies swiftly seized Roman territories in the Orient and Africa. Determined not to repeat past mistakes, we must endeavor to bring an end to this conflict once and for all, be it through diplomacy or the annihilation of Persia."

Stretching from the northern reaches of Britain to the Sahara, and from the Atlantic coast to the Euphrates, their appetite for conquest knows no bounds, as evidenced by their numerous wars against us. This was the very region Alexander the Great had swept through, igniting a vision of glory and conquest that captivated Greeks and Romans alike. The epic rivalry between the ancient world's two great superpowers is a legendary tale immortalized in history books.\n\nNow that our empire has risen from the ashes, so too have the Romans, particularly following their conquest of our ancient capital, Ctesiphon. Tensions mount along our shared border, sparking fears of a resurgence of the Roman-Persian War after centuries. The drain on resources during the prolonged Roman-Persian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable.

Initially, we were poised to send Rome an ultimatum, demanding Caucasia and Mesopotamia. However, upon considering the sheer devastation and ruin that the war would inflict upon both titans, the Shahanshah of Persia has contemplated stepping back. We can offer Rome a pact that could bring an end to the age-old, futile rivalry between our two great powers.

While the two empires are too distant to establish official diplomatic relations, traders and envoys have traversed the great distance between them throughout history.\n\nHowever, change is on the horizon. The expansionist [ROM.GetName], encroaching upon China's borders, especially after news of the fall of the Persian Empire at the hands of the Romans reached the Dragon Throne, has made the Dragon Emperor realize that they may soon become the next target of Roman expansion.

While the two empires are too distant to establish official diplomatic relations, traders and envoys have traversed the great distance between them throughout history.\n\nHowever, change is on the horizon. The expansionist [ROM.GetName], encroaching upon our borders, especially after news of the fall of the Persian Empire at the hands of the Romans reached the Dragon Throne, has made the Dragon Emperor realize that we may soon become the next target of Roman conquests. We must fortify our defenses at all costs, as Rome seeks to destroy our legacy for good. The Chinese Dragon and the Roman Phoenix - only one can emerge victorious."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.91.t:0 "Dioceses Refuse to Join"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.91.d:0 "The invasion of China would demand hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of manpower and an equivalent amount of resources from the entire empire.

However, their involvement also poses a significant threat: despite their size, the majority of their population is concentrated in Europe, leaving much of their shared border with China undefended. Moreover, the Chinese Emperor has long coveted these lands and would undoubtedly seize them if given the chance. My liege, should we request their assistance in the war?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.94.a:0 "We can defeat the Emperor before he poses a threat to our subject territory"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.95.d:0 "News of the impending war between the two world superpowers has reached the court of the Great Khan. The people of the steppes have always coveted the riches of China, and numerous raids have been conducted, albeit with limited success due to the heavily fortified border. However, they now see an opportunity for a grand distraction, one that could draw the Imperial Army away from the Great Wall. Sensing the moment is ripe, the Great Khan has pledged allegiance to us in the war, with the condition that they may claim any land they manage to seize from China and receive some 'investments' from us to aid in prolonging their war effort."

However, their aspirations have been stymied by Korea's protection under the Emperor of China, thwarting any attempts by the ambitious Japanese to conquer the peninsula. This status quo has persisted for years, but it hasn't deterred Japan from seeking a solution to break free from it. They recognize the need for an ally in the west to flank China from both sides, thus enabling them to defeat Korea before any reinforcements from the Dragon Emperor arrive. Now, with this opportunity at hand, Japan has dispatched envoys to us, proposing an alliance. However, they demand that any land they seize in Korea and coastal Chinese provinces will be theirs to claim. Furthermore, they seek our assistance in their modernization efforts by sharing any technological advancements we possess."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.99.t:0 "The Fall of China"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.99.d:0 "The age-old rivalry between the Phoenix of the West and the Dragon of the East has reached its climax. Roman legions march triumphantly through the once-proud lands of the Dragon Emperor, their banners fluttering over the soil of the Middle Kingdom. The might of Rome has brought about the total collapse of China and the annihilation of the Mandate of Heaven. However, to subjugate this fractured empire now would be a reckless endeavor. Across the land, regional warlords have risen, each seeking to carve out their own domain from the remnants of the fallen empire, like vultures descending upon a carcass. For now, it is prudent to refrain from further entanglement and to await a more opportune moment to assert Rome's dominance over these lands."

 ab_nicaea.8.t:0 "Rebirth of Hellenism - Culture"
 ab_nicaea.8.d:0 "We have torn down their statues, stripped them of power and wealth, and every day we strive to reverse the Romanization of Greece. Yet, despite our efforts and our disdain for the Empire, our fury remains unquenched. The crimes of Rome against Hellas are countless, but perhaps the most insidious is the indoctrination of Greeks into the Roman identity. As time passes, we seek ever more radical solutions to purge ourselves of this Latin disease, yet it seems our efforts are never enough to truly purify Greece in the eyes of our ancestors.\n\nIn recent years, a radical faction has emerged within our court, advocating for an extreme solution: to completely sever ties with the "Byzantine Greek" culture and restore the Hellenic culture of the pre-Roman era. This audacious idea finds support among the Great Houses, and so the ancient Hellenic culture is reborn in [Root.GetName], beginning from the city of [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 ab_nicaea.8.a:0 "A true Greek culture, untainted by the influence of greedy Romans"

 ab_nicaea.12.t:0 "Antigonid Magna Graecia"
 ab_nicaea.12.d:0 "Back in antiquity, Southern Italia gleamed as the jewel of the Mediterranean Sea. Numerous thriving Greek cities flourished in the region, forming what became known as Magna Graecia — a name bestowed by the Romans, who coveted the wealth and prosperity of our people. Yet, this land could not escape the grasp of Roman conquests, and many of its once-prosperous cities, such as Syracuse, were left devastated, mere shadows of their former glory.\n\nCenturies passed, the land has changed hands multiple times until falling under the dominion of the Hafsids. But today, Magna Graecia has returned to Hellenic rule. We shall establish a local government, with the Great House Antigonos at its helm. Together, we will restore Magna Graecia to its rightful place of glory and splendor."
 ab_nicaea.12.a:0 "This will firmly establish our rule over Italia"

 ab_nicaea.13.t:0 "Seleucid Kingdom"
 ab_nicaea.13.d:0 "Among all of Alexander's Diadochi Kingdoms, none can rival the strength and success of the Seleucid Kingdom of Nikator. Rising to the status of an empire in its own right, it stands as the first Helleno-Persian empire in history, capable even of challenging the mighty Mauryan Empire.\n\nDuring its golden age, the Seleucid Kingdom witnessed the zenith of Hellenic culture, traditions, and values, extending its influence to the distant lands of India and even China.\n\nWith the fall of Persia, the Great House Seleukos now seeks to reclaim their ancient kingdom, starting with our recently conquered lands in Mesopotamia and Persia."

Some whisper of foreign powers' involvement, while others insist that the Great Houses are behind the tragedy.\n\nWith no suitable heir from the Royal House to ascend the throne, a general from the house of Parmelion has been appointed as the Supreme Regent. This move aims to thwart any attempts by the Great Houses to seize power for themselves. While welcomed by many generals and nobles, this decision has sparked outrage among the Great Houses, prompting them to reveal their true intentions.\n\nIt is unveiled that the assassinations were orchestrated by the Great Houses, and now, unable to claim the throne directly, they have mobilized their supporters across the empire to wage war against their rivals.\n\nThe entire Hellenic world is engulfed in conflict, as factions vie for dominance. Soon, a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be crowned from the house of..."
