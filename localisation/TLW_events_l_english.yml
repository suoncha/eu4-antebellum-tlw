 ab_byzantium.47.t:0 "Belisarius"
 ab_byzantium.47.d:0 "Belisarius was one of the greatest generals our empire ever had. Being a military commander of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian, he was instrumental in the reconquest of much of the Mediterranean territory belonging to the former Western Empire, which had been lost less than a century prior.\n\nOne of the defining features of Belisarius' career was his success despite varying levels of available resources. His name is frequently given as one of the so-called "Last of the Romans". He conquered the Vandals in nine months and much of Italy during the Gothic War, despite being significantly outnumbered, he and his troops recaptured the city of Rome and then held out against great odds.\n\nNow that our invincible army is unmatched, a first-rate general is still needed to lead them. Within our generals in the Strategos Office, one man is head and shoulders above the rest. Despite coming from a lowborn family, his extraordinary skills help him rising to become one of the best in spite of his young age. The army hails him as reincarnated Belisarius, from which he changed his name to. He should be the one to take on the mantle."
 ab_byzantium.47.a:0 "Roma Invicta!"
 ab_byzantium.48.t:0 "Byzantine Military Reforms"
 ab_byzantium.48.d:0 "The Roman Army was once the most feared and renowned army in the world. But those times has gone by, as our enemies have improved so much to make us reduced to this petty of a state, causing by countless devastating wars and military failures. It's true that we can't keep living in the past, we must pass many military reforms inorder to protect ourselves. First thing we do is re-militarizing our citizen into a formidable force."
 ab_byzantium.48.a:0 "Forwards men!"
 ab_byzantium.49.t:0 "Hellenization of the Bulgars"
 ab_byzantium.49.d:0 "The Bulgars have always been a major thorn in our side. Endless wars with them led us to our downfall, followed by their barbaric pillaging and destruction, but now, the tables have turned into our favor and we are the masters of their lands, we shall proceed to banish them back to the Volga and assimilate those who wish to stay by restoring the old culture of Roman Thracia."
 ab_byzantium.49.a:0 "Only us are the true masters of the Balkans"
 ab_byzantium.50.t:0 "Hellenization of the Balkans"
 ab_byzantium.50.d:0 "Back in the time of Justinian, Balkans was still the land of Romanized and Hellenized Illyrian people. Many great men was born Illyrian, from the likes of Aurelian, Constantine, Valentinianus and even Justinian himself. The Plague has came and decimated nearly all the natives. But with the Slavs migration, they made this region becoming populated and thriving again.\n \nFor many years the Balkans Slavic people have tried to adopt our ways of life to an extent. With the recent reconquest of the Balkans, this region should be restored back to its former glorious days. Let us integrate the locals and teach them how to be proper Romans."

 ab_byzantium.51.d:0 "Those cowardly bastards have declared war on us! While this outcome is already anticipated, we still can't afford to lose this war. Their insolence has been ignored for too long, we must take back what is rightfully our, ending their status once and for all!"

 ab_byzantium.52.t:0 "Occupation of [NCI.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.52.d:0 "After many months of war, we have finally put an end to the pretender Kingdom of Nicaea. Our recent successful capture of their capital has denied them any hope for a victory. The pathetic [NCI.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to give up his kingdom and pay reparation with the condition of sparing his life. Rejoice! From now on, this region is once again under our rule."
 ab_byzantium.52.a:0 "Peace at last!"
 ab_byzantium.53.t:0 "War with Bulgaria"
 ab_byzantium.53.d:0 "My lord! News has reached us that Bulgar's allies may come to their aid! Perhaps if we siege down their capital quickly, we can break their morale enough to negotiate a peace agreement."
 ab_byzantium.53.a:0 "We must act, fast!"
 ab_war_bulgaria_info:0 "If we manage to secure a quick victory by occupying §Y[BUL.Capital.GetName]§! and reaching §Y40%§! war score against them within 15 months, they will be forced to surrender and we will get back our cores"
 ab_byzantium.54.t:0 "Occupation of [BUL.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.54.d:0 "After many months of war, we have defeated the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Our recent successful capture of their capital has broken their morale enough to make [BUL.Monarch.GetName] agrees to give up our cores and pay reparation. Rejoice! From now on, all of Greece is once again under our rule."

 ab_byzantium.57.t:0 "Italia Ambition"
 ab_byzantium.57.d:0 "With the conquest of Albania, the Strait of Otranto is the only thing left separates us with Roman homeland. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided that it's the right time to cross the strait and take back Italia."
 ab_byzantium.57.a:0 "Italia shall be reconquered!"
 ab_byzantium.58.t:0 "Integration of Romanians"
 ab_byzantium.58.d:0 "After reforming the Roman Empire, Carpathia was reorganized as an administrative division of Diocesis Illyria. We can merge our former Romanian subjects into the new Diocese territory."

 ab_byzantium.59.a:0 "Understood"
 ab_byzantium.60.t:0 "Defeated The Sea"
 ab_byzantium.60.d:0 "In the first century, Emperor Caligula led an ill-conceived campaign to Britain, which made it to the furthest shores of Gaul before being aborted. As returning to Rome without a victory was unthinkable, Caligula declared war on Neptune, god of the sea, and had the waves whipped. His soldiers were ordered to collect seashells as prizes of war.\n\nA mad man as he may seem to be, we Romans have truly conquered all the Seven Seas. This undeniable feat of us proves that even the sea shall fall under the Roman might."
 ab_byzantium.60.a:0 "Romans are the masters of all the land and all the sea"
 ab_byzantium.61.t:0 "Punics in the New World"
 ab_byzantium.61.d:0 "This is unbelievable!\n\nWhen our explorers reach the shore of the land across the Atlantic Ocean, they saw nothing like they had imagined: bustling ports filled by people from many alien cultures and religions in a same place, even comparable with our most prosperous cities. At first they did think that maybe we're all wrong about barbarians are uncivilized things, but then they finally learned the truth - the Punics. Back in the Antiquity, that sly Hannibal has fled to this continent, brought with him thousands of Punics under our nose.\n\nAnd those Punics too haven't forgot about us, their ancient nemesis. It was such a mistake of our explorers that they revealed themselves as Romans whilst trading in the local market. Some of them got caught while others managed to escape to deliver the news."
 ab_byzantium.61.a:0 "Do they want another Punic War? So be it"
 ab_byzantium.62.t:0 "Unification of Orthodox World"
 ab_byzantium.62.d:0 "The Russians have endured the tyranny of the Tatar Yoke and infighting for hundreds of year whilst we can not do anything to help them. Now that we have healed the Schism, many bishops in their realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the Patriarch in Constantinople. Our way is clear to become the First, Second and Third Rome all in one, and we must not spoil this golden opportunity. Rejoice, Mother Rus, for your children will become Roman citizens!"
 ab_byzantium.62.a:0 "I shall unite the princes in the name of Rus!"
 ab_byzantium.62.b:0 "I shall become the Tsar of Rus!"
 BYZ_RUSSIAN_PRINCES:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gain §YRestoration of Union§! Casus Belli on §Yevery Orthodox Russian Principality§!.\nThis Casus Belli will last for §G25§! years."
 ab_byzantium.63.t:0 "Belgica Identity"
 ab_byzantium.63.d:0 "Belgica has been conquered but due to its small size, we have to integrate them to an adjacent Diocese. But where should Belgica belong to is a question yet to be answered. Speaking history, Belgica was usually grouped with Gallia in the times before the fall of the Western half. But on the cultural aspect, the local Dutch people is closer to German than French."
 ab_byzantium.63.a:0 "Belgica is a part of Gallia"
 ab_byzantium.63.b:0 "Belgica is a part of Germania"
 BYZ_GALLIA_BELGICA:0 "The §YFrancus§! culture will naturally spread across §YLow Countries§! region\n§YLow Countries§! provinces can be ceded to §YDiocesis Gallia§!"
 BYZ_GERMANIA_BELGICA:0 "The §YGermanus§! culture will naturally spread across §YLow Countries§! region\n§YLow Countries§! provinces can be ceded to §YDiocesis Germania§!"
 ab_byzantium.15.d:0 "The Empire has come out of the Crisis stronger than ever. We have restructured our court, uprooted the corruption festering in our state, and rebuilt our army to an acceptable standard. The Angelos had managed to avert the nosedive that Byzantium was taking, however, they did not accomplish this on their own. It took the cooperation of multiple noble houses to facilitate this rapid rebirth of the Byzantine state, some of whom aspired to take the crown for themselves.\n \n The house of laskaris, Komnenos, Doukas, and several others all eye the throne for their own and are debating the merits of an overthrowing of the Angelos. Now would be the opportune time; should these factions seek to take down the Angelos, they could do so in the name of reform and progress, and the rest of the ruling elite would accept them as the new Emperors. However, some doubt the plan; the Angelos are now more powerful than they have ever been before. With the reformed army and court behind them, they will not only bring prosperity to the Empire, but they would also be incredibly difficult to overthrow. Back and forth they went, until they settled on a path. And so, as the phoenix rises from the ash…"
 ab_byzantium.64.t:0 "Master of Europe"
 ab_byzantium.64.d:0 "Risen from the ash, from the sack of Rome, from the near-destruction of the Roman Empire by the hands of the Huns, the Goths, the Persians, the Arabs, the Turks, the Crusaders to the Bulgars, from the betrayal of Gabras and the Angelid Crisis, Roman existence has been threaten for uncountable times. Nonetheless, our people had managed to stand against all odds and defend the Empire. Not only that, we could reconquered the territories that we thought are lost forever.\n\nThis is truly a memorable day, as the Roman people have subjugated all of Europe - such a feat that our ancestors couldn't ever dream of. Roman citizens, rejoice! From now on, no barbarian shall take away the Light of Rome from you!"
 ab_byzantium.64.a:0 "Finally, the true Pax Romana!"
 BYZ_BUFFED_AUGUSTUS:0 "§YAugustus§! trait will be enhanced by §G2§! times"
 ab_byzantium.65.t:0 "Romanization of Rus"
 ab_byzantium.65.d:0 "Having been under Roman rule for over a century, the culture of Rus people has changed dramastically. It began by East Slavic nobles adopting our alphabet, language and customs, following by the regional governors and peasants over time. At the present time, most of the citizens of [UKR.GetName] are speaking an East Slavic dialect of Roman rather than their ancestor tongue. They also refuse to be refered as Russian nor Ruthenian. Instead, they defined themselves as Ruthenicus"
 ab_byzantium.65.a:0 "Welcome to our cultural sphere!"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] has proved to be just another incompetent ruler like his Angelid predecessors. As hard as he tried, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] still can not fix the grave problem that has threatened our sovereignty for many decades. Our patience has reached its limit. If our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not capable of saving us, maybe we can forge ourselves a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

Furthermore, with the reconquest of Rome, many councilors encouraged the Emperor to reforge the old empire. While we're already the rightful successors of Rome, the people of the West hardly recognize our claim. To them, we're no more than the Empire of the Greeks. Therefore, to legitimaze our status according to the Western view, our bureaucracy needs some changes. It would be best to incorporate values from both the Latin and Greek worlds.\n\nAs this sudden reformation would trigger unrest among our population, the Imperial Army is put on standby and ready for any kind of revolt. But against all expectations, a calamity hit us as a giant asteroid from outer space landed into Mount Thera, which caused a massive eruption that darkened and filled the sky of Aegean Sea with dust and ashes.
