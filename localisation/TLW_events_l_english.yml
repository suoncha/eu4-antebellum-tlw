 ab_byzantium.47.t:0 "Belisarius"
 ab_byzantium.47.d:0 "Belisarius was one of the greatest generals our empire ever had. Being a military commander of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian, he was instrumental in the reconquest of much of the Mediterranean territory belonging to the former Western Empire, which had been lost less than a century prior.\n\nOne of the defining features of Belisarius' career was his success despite varying levels of available resources. His name is frequently given as one of the so-called "Last of the Romans". He conquered the Vandals in nine months and much of Italy during the Gothic War, despite being significantly outnumbered, he and his troops recaptured the city of Rome and then held out against great odds.\n\nNow that our invincible army is unmatched, a first-rate general is still needed to lead them. Within our generals in the Strategos Office, one man is head and shoulders above the rest. Despite coming from a lowborn family, his extraordinary skills help him rising to become one of the best in spite of his young age. The army hails him as reincarnated Belisarius, from which he changed his name to. He should be the one to take on the mantle."

 ab_byzantium.48.d:0 "The Roman Army was once the most feared and renowned army in the world. But those times has gone by, as our enemies have improved so much to make us reduced to this petty of a state, causing by countless devastating wars and military failures. It's true that we can't keep living in the past, we must pass many military reforms inorder to protect ourselves. First thing we do is re-militarizing our citizen into a formidable force."

 ab_byzantium.50.d:0 "Back in the time of Justinian, Balkans was still the land of Romanized and Hellenized Illyrian people. Many great men was born Illyrian, from the likes of Aurelian, Constantine, Valentinianus and even Justinian himself. The Plague has came and decimated nearly all the natives. But with the Slavs migration, they made this region becoming populated and thriving again.\n \nFor many years the Balkans Slavic people have tried to adopt our ways of life to an extent. With the recent reconquest of the Balkans, this region should be restored back to its former glorious days. Let us integrate the locals and teach them how to be proper Romans."

But they can't develop themselves\n- They don't take your diplomatic slot, only count their own relative power for liberty desire\n- They won't join your wars automatically. You have to pay 25-50 favors to call them in and it would displease them by doing so\n- They pay higher tax, manpower, forcelimit and trade power to you than normal subjects\n- They can only be annexed if all of their provinces are romanized and it would anger other Dioceses\n- Each of them grants you §G1§! merchant and affect a specific faction influence\n- They have modifiers for unromanized and romanized provinces\n- They can only be created, ceded provinces via §YDiocese Management§! menu\n- They have some interaction events with the Imperial Throne, which is you"

 ab_byzantium.60.d:0 "In the first century, Emperor Caligula led an ill-conceived campaign to Britain, which made it to the furthest shores of Gaul before being aborted. As returning to Rome without a victory was unthinkable, Caligula declared war on Neptune, god of the sea, and had the waves whipped. His soldiers were ordered to collect seashells as prizes of war.\n\nA mad man as he may seem to be, we Romans have truly conquered all the Seven Seas. This undeniable feat of us proves that even the sea shall fall under the Roman might."

 ab_byzantium.61.d:0 "This is unbelievable!\n\nWhen our explorers reach the shore of the land across the Atlantic Ocean, they saw nothing like they had imagined: bustling ports filled by people from many alien cultures and religions in a same place, even comparable with our most prosperous cities. At first they did think that maybe we're all wrong about barbarians are uncivilized things, but then they finally learned the truth - the Punics. Back in the Antiquity, that sly Hannibal has fled to this continent, brought with him thousands of Punics under our nose.\n\nAnd those Punics too haven't forgot about us, their ancient nemesis. It was such a mistake of our explorers that they revealed themselves as Romans whilst trading in the local market. Some of them got caught while others managed to escape to deliver the news."
 ab_byzantium.61.a:0 "Do they want another Punic War? So be it"
 ab_byzantium.62.t:0 "Unification of Orthodox World"
 ab_byzantium.62.d:0 "The Russians have endured the tyranny of the Tatar Yoke and infighting for hundreds of year whilst we can not do anything to help them. Now that we have healed the Schism, many bishops in their realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the Patriarch in Constantinople. Our way is clear to become the First, Second and Third Rome all in one, and we must not spoil this golden opportunity. Rejoice, Mother Rus, for your children will become Roman citizens!"

 ab_byzantium.63.d:0 "Belgica has been conquered but due to its small size, we have to integrate them to an adjacent Diocese. But where should Belgica belong to is a question yet to be answered.

Nonetheless, our people had managed to stand against all odds and defend the Empire. Not only that, we could reconquered the territories that we thought are lost forever.\n\nThis is truly a memorable day, as the Roman people have subjugated all of Europe - such a feat that our ancestors couldn't ever dream of.

It began by East Slavic nobles adopting our alphabet, language and customs, following by the regional governors and peasants over time. At the present time, most of the citizens of [UKR.GetName] are speaking an East Slavic dialect of Roman rather than their ancestor tongue. They also refuse to be refered as Russian nor Ruthenian.

 ab_byzantium.88.d:0 "The three kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia are the Iberian Peninsula's last bastions of Christianity, having fended off the ever-growing shadow of Andalusia for generations. Upon the heathens' initial thrust into Visigothic lands, many who had attempted to muster resistance were merely swatted aside. However, one noble by the name of Pelagius was eventually able to stage a rebellion against the newly-arrived oppressors. From the courage of himself and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias was forged. The Crown of Asturias subsequently passed to Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria. Before his own death, he had carved out a realm comprising both Galicia and Asturias, but long after Adelfun's passing dynastic squabbles would permanently separate the two realms. Navarra's successful bid for independence was much more of a miracle. In the 9th Century AD Inigo Arista, Lord of Pamplona successfully threw out a Carolingian invasion force before also raising the flag of rebellion against his Muslim overlords. His actions successfully consolidated power for the Jimenez Dynasty and would result in the rise of Navarra.\n\nIn AD 1443, the Iberians have suffered a great defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles from all across the Holy Roman Empire and in Iberia itself fell outside the gates of Valencia, erstwhile the lands in the north were burnt to ashes by Christian raiding parties intending to starve out the Muslim forces in pursuit. The combined threat of famine and a renewed offensive were only staved off by a hasty peace agreement between the Franks and Umayyads, yet this would ill suffice in the eyes of the Iberian crusaders. Feeling betrayed and with their faith dashed in a single campaign, the future remains uncertain."

This has caused a shift in our nation demography, as they don't want to be seen as a mere [Root.GetName]. The Iberian people from [227.GetName] to [213.GetName] are calling for a change to our identity, and there are two popular opinions.
