#Byzantium/Rome
 ab_byzantium.47.t: "Belisarius Reborn"
 ab_byzantium.47.d: "Belisarius, a formidable commander of the Byzantine Empire during Justinian's reign, played a crucial role in reclaiming lost Mediterranean territories from the Western Empire. Despite resource constraints, he earned the esteemed title 'Last of the Romans' for his remarkable feats such as conquering the Vandals in nine months and securing much of Italy during the Gothic War, including the recapture of Rome. Now, with our invincible army poised for further conquests, a standout general is required to lead them. Among our Strategos Office ranks, one individual stands out. Despite humble origins, his exceptional talents have propelled him to greatness, earning him comparisons to the legendary Belisarius. He is the natural choice to inherit the mantle of leadership."
 ab_byzantium.47.a: "The Strategos Office shall follow his guidance"

 ab_byzantium.48.t: "Byzantine Military Reforms"
 ab_byzantium.48.d: "The once formidable Roman Army, renowned across the world, has seen its glory fade in the wake of devastating wars and military failures. As our adversaries advance, we find ourselves diminished, unable to rely solely on past achievements. It's imperative that we adapt to the evolving battlefield. Our first step is the re-militarization of our citizenry, forging them into a formidable force capable of defending our empire."
 ab_byzantium.48.a: "Let us restart the age of Roman expansion"

 ab_byzantium.49.t: "Hellenization of the Bulgars"
 ab_byzantium.49.d: "For centuries, the Bulgars have been a relentless adversary, contributing to our empire's decline and suffering. Yet, fate has shifted in our favor, granting us dominion over their lands. Now, as masters of their territory, we must act decisively. We shall drive them back to the Volga, expelling their menace from our borders. Those who choose to remain shall be assimilated, embracing the customs of their new lords."
 ab_byzantium.49.a: "We hold the legitimate claim as the sovereigns of the Balkans"

 ab_byzantium.50.t: "Hellenization of the Balkans"
 ab_byzantium.50.d: "During the reign of Justinian, the Balkans were inhabited by Romanized and Hellenized Illyrian people, which was the homeland of great Roman emperors such as Aurelian, Constantine, Valentinianus, and even Justinian himself. However, the devastating Justinian Plague ravaged the region, leaving destruction in its wake. With the subsequent migration of the Slavs, Illyria experienced a resurgence in population and vitality.\n\nOver the years, the Slavic people of the Balkans have attempted to adopt Christianity and embrace aspects of our Roman way of life. With the recent reconquest of the Balkans, it is time to restore this region to its former glory. Let us integrate the locals and impart upon them the virtues of Roman civilization."
 ab_byzantium.50.a: "Illyria will thrive once again"

 ab_byzantium.51.t: "Nicaean Invasion"
 ab_byzantium.51.d: "The traitorous Nicaeans have declared war on us! While not entirely unexpected, we cannot afford to lose this conflict. Their insolence has gone unchecked for far too long. It is time to reclaim what is ours and put an end to their defiance once and for all!"
 ab_byzantium.51.a: "Down with the Stratocracy!"

 ab_byzantium.52.t: "Occupation of [NCI.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.52.d: "After months of relentless conflict, we have dealt a decisive blow to the pretender Kingdom of Nicaea. With the capture of [NCI.Capital.GetName], their hopes for victory have been shattered. Rejoice! The western coast of Anatolia is now firmly back under our control."
 ab_byzantium.52.a: "Peace, at last"

 ab_byzantium.53.t: "Bulgarian Invasion"
 ab_byzantium.53.d: "Your Majesty! Reports indicate that Bulgaria has resumed our conflict. We must consider a swift siege of their capital to weaken their resolve and potentially force them into negotiations for peace."
 ab_byzantium.53.a: "We will reach [BUL.Capital.GetName] in months!"

 ab_byzantium.54.t: "Occupation of [BUL.Capital.GetName]"
 ab_byzantium.54.d: "After months of relentless conflict, victory is ours! The Kingdom of Bulgaria has capitulated, their once-proud capital now under our mercy. [BUL.Monarch.GetName] has been forced to concede, relinquishing our rightful territories and offering reparations. Cheers, for Greece is now united!"
 ab_byzantium.54.a: "Macedonia is just the beginning of our military campaigns"

 ab_byzantium.57.t: "Italian Ambition"
 ab_byzantium.57.d: "With the annexation of Albania, the Strait of Otranto stands as the final barrier between us and the Roman heartland - Italia. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has deemed this the opportune moment to launch an assault across the sea and reclaim the peninsula."
 ab_byzantium.57.a: "Italia shall be reconquered"

 ab_byzantium.58.t: "Integration of the Romanians"
 ab_byzantium.58.d: "After the restoration of [Root.GetName], Carpathia was integrated as an administrative region within Diocese Dacia. This presents an opportunity to incorporate our former Romanian subjects into the territory of the new Diocese."
 ab_byzantium.58.a: "Certainly"
 ab_byzantium.58.b: "I will keep them around for a while"

 ab_byzantium.59.t: "Diocese System"
 ab_byzantium.59.d: "Rome - a vast nation, is far too stretched to be governed effiently from the Central Government. Thus, Roman Diocese, the regional governance district made up of a grouping of provinces each headed by an elected Vicarius, was created in the Late Empire era to address this problem. The Vicars are tasked with overseeing their Dioceses, affording them a semblance of autonomy within the broader empire. This unique status grants them several special features:\n- Each Diocese grants us §G1§! Merchant and §YMonthly Influence§! of a specific §YCultural Sphere§!\n- Developing Diocese provinces changes §YInfluence§! of our §YCultural Spheres§!. But they cannot develop provinces on their own\n- Dioceses have access to §GRomanization§! mechanic\n- Dioceses do not take our diplomatic slot and only count their own relative power for liberty desire\n- Dioceses will not join our wars automatically. We have to pay §R25§! to §R50§! favors to call them in and it would displease them by doing so\n- Dioceses pay higher tax, manpower, forcelimit and trade power to us than normal subjects\n- Dioceses can only be annexed if all of their provinces are §GRomanized§!\n- Dioceses have modifiers for both §RUnromanized§! and §GRomanized§! provinces\n- Dioceses can only be created, transfered provinces through §YDiocese Management§! menu, which can be accessed by a button in the Decision Tab\n- Dioceses can trigger flavor events"
 ab_byzantium.59.a: "Understood"

 ab_byzantium.60.t: "Conqueror of the Seven Seas"
 ab_byzantium.60.d: "In the annals of Roman history, there exists a tale as audacious as it is absurd. In the first century, Caligula the lunatic emperor, driven by his insatiable thirst for conquest, embarked on a campaign to Britain. Yet, the fates conspired against him, for the journey barely reached the shores of Gaul before it was unceremoniously halted.\n\nBut returning to Rome without the laurels of victory was inconceivable for Caligula. In a fit of madness, he declared war not on mortal foes, but on Neptune himself, god of the sea. With hubris unmatched, he commanded his legions to whip the waves into submission. Seashells, humble treasures of the shore, were hailed as spoils of this bizarre conflict.\n\nThough history may mock his folly, the legacy of Caligula's expedition endures. Today, Rome has conquered every corner of the globe. Even the vast expanse of the Seven Seas was not beyond the reach of Roman ambition, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Eternal City."
 ab_byzantium.60.a: "The true Mare Nostrum"

 ab_byzantium.61.t: "Punics in the New World"
 ab_byzantium.61.d: "This is astonishing! As our brave explorers set foot on the shores of the distant land across the Atlantic Ocean, they were met with a sight unlike anything they had ever imagined. Bustling ports teeming with people from diverse cultures and religions, rivaling even our most prosperous cities. Initially, there was a fleeting thought that perhaps our preconceived notions of barbarism were mistaken, but the truth soon emerged - there were no barbarians but the Punics.\n\nBy trading with locals, we learned that the cunning Hannibal had sought refuge on this distant continent during the Antiquity, bringing with him thousands of Punics right under our noses to avoid the demise of their civilization causing by our ancestors's wrath.\n\nAlthough many centuries have passed, these Punics have not forgotten their rivalry with the Romans. Unfortunately, some of our explorers have been recognized as their ancient enemy which proved to be a grave mistake. Some were captured, while others managed to evade capture and return with this shocking news. Rome has some cities to burn."
 ab_byzantium.61.a: "Are they looking for another Punic War? Then so shall they have it!"

 ab_byzantium.62.t: "Unification of the Orthodox World"
 ab_byzantium.62.d: "The Russian people have long suffered under the yoke of the Tatars and internal strife, while we, bound by circumstance, could offer little aid. With the healing of the Schism, many bishops in Rus still not acknowledge our authority, instead proclaimed their own Autocephaly that are separated from the Patriarch in Constantinople. The path is now clear for us to unite all the First, Second, and Third Rome. Let us not squander this historic moment. Mother Rus, your sons and daughters will soon join the ranks of Roman subjects."
 ab_byzantium.62.a: "We shall unite the princes in the name of Rus!"
 ab_byzantium.62.b: "We shall become the Tsar of Rus!"

 ab_byzantium.63.t: "Roman Belgica"
 ab_byzantium.63.d: "Belgica - the Lands Between, historically linked with Gallia in the annals of antiquity, yet its cultural tapestry weaves a different tale. The local Dutch populace, being closer in kinship to their German neighbors than the Gallian French, complicates matters even further. As we contemplate integration of Belgica into an adjacent Diocese, the question looms large: to which region shall Belgica belong? The answer remains elusive, shrouded in the fog of history and the nuances of identity."
 ab_byzantium.63.a: "Belgica is an integral part of Gallia"
 ab_byzantium.63.b: "Belgica is an integral part of Germania"

 ab_byzantium.64.t: "Rulers of Europe"
 ab_byzantium.64.d: "Emerging from the ruins, from the ravages of war and conflict by countless foes - from the Huns to the Persians, from the Arabs to the Crusaders, from treachery and invasion threats - Rome has withstood the test of time. Despite facing threats from all directions, our resilience has prevailed. We have not only defended our borders but reclaimed lands thought lost forever.\n\nToday marks a historic triumph as the Roman people extend their dominion over all of Europe. This achievement surpasses the wildest ambitions of our predecessors. Citizens of Rome, celebrate! The Light of Rome shines brighter than ever before, and no force can extinguish it!"
 ab_byzantium.64.a: "Finally, we have achieved Pax Romana!"

 ab_byzantium.65.t: "Romanization of Rus"
 ab_byzantium.65.d: "After a century under Roman dominion, the cultural landscape of Rus has undergone profound transformation. Initially, it was the East Slavic nobility who embraced Roman language, customs and traditions, a trend that gradually permeated through all strata of society over time. Presently, the majority of Slavic people converses in an East Slavic variant of Roman, forsaking their native tongue. Moreover, a notable shift in identity is observed as they reject the labels of Russian or Ruthenian, opting instead for the designation of Ruthenicus."
 ab_byzantium.65.a: "And then the Roman culture expanded"

 ab_byzantium.67.t: "Restoration of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.67.d: "We have eclipsed Justinian's achievements and other pretenders by restoring the true Rome, stretching from Iberia to the Levant. Despite being powerful as we are now, the empire comes with unique mechanics that demand careful management.\n\nFirstly, the §GRomanization§! mechanic will automatically convert our owned provinces to the §YRoman§! culture group. This process can be sped up through various means, detailed in the '§YRomanization§!' button in Decision Tab.\n\nSecondly, the §GCultural Sphere§! government reform introduces two initial factions - Latins and Greeks - with two more can be §Gunlocked§! through missions. Balancing favor between them is crucial to avoid triggering the §RBiased Cultural Sphere§! disaster, causing a massive revolt and breakup of the empire.\n\nNext, we have the §RPersian War§! disaster that can be triggered by bordering Persia. Completing it will §Gunlock§! more missions for eastern expansion. Note that if you started as @SRK §YSarukhanids§!, you will bypass this disaster completely.\n\nLastly, the §GDiocese§! subject type offers a new form of governance which will be explained in the following page."
 ab_byzantium.67.a: "What is a Diocese?"

 ab_byzantium.68.t: "Consul Election"
 ab_byzantium.68.d1: "The term is up for $MONARCH$. We must choose the next Consul from..."
 ab_byzantium.68.d2: "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election. We must choose the next Consul from..."
 ab_byzantium.68.a: "...the Latinsphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.b: "...the Hellenosphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.c: "...the Persosphere"
 ab_byzantium.68.d: "...the Sinosphere"

 ab_byzantium.69.t: "Suppressed Diocese"
 ab_byzantium.69.d: "The Diocese Rebellion has finally been suppressed. Now we have to decide their fate."
 ab_byzantium.69.a: "Reintegrated into our direct governance"
 ab_byzantium.69.b: "Keep them as Diocese"

 ab_byzantium.70.t: "Heritage Trait Gained"
 ab_byzantium.70.d: "You have earned a Rome Heritage modifier based on your starting nation."
 ab_byzantium.70.a: "Great"

 ab_byzantium.72.t: "General's Specialization"
 ab_byzantium.72.d: "Select a General's Specialization for the next 10 years."
 ab_byzantium.72.a: "Fire"
 ab_byzantium.72.b: "Shock"
 ab_byzantium.72.c: "Manuever"
 ab_byzantium.72.e: "Siege"

 ab_byzantium.73.t: "Maximum Imperial Professionalism Reached"
 ab_byzantium.73.d: "The Roman Army has become excessively centralized, making it nearly impossible to coordinate with our Dioceses."
 ab_byzantium.73.a: "We should further decentralize the army"

 ab_byzantium.74.t: "Maximum Diocese Professionalism Reached"
 ab_byzantium.74.d: "The Roman Army has become too decentralized, rendering our professional army useless."
 ab_byzantium.74.a: "We should further centralize the army"

 ab_byzantium.78.t: "Roman Caucasia"
 ab_byzantium.78.d: "Caucasia has long been the main battleground between the Roman and Persian Empires, witnessing centuries of conflict. From the lush valleys of Georgia and Armenia to the rugged mountains of the Caucasus, it has been a theater of strife, where the blood of Romans, Persians, and mercenaries alike has soaked into the ancient soil. With Persia now under our control, we must decide the path of Caucasia. Will it align with the Hellenic Anatolia or remain part of the Persian world?"
 ab_byzantium.78.a: "Caucasia falls within the sphere of Anatolia"
 ab_byzantium.78.b: "Caucasia falls within the sphere of Persia"

 ab_byzantium.79.t: "Reconquest of the Levant"
 ab_byzantium.79.d: "The Levant, once a proud possession of the Roman Empire, now lies under the dominion of the Saracens. Despite centuries of Muslim rule and resistance against numerous Crusades launched by the Catholics, the Levant remains firmly in their grasp. However, the tides of history are shifting, as our legions are poised to reclaim the lost territories in the Levant, restoring Imperial authority to these lands once more."
 ab_byzantium.79.a: "Our adversaries shall quake in fear before our might"

 ab_byzantium.80.t: "The Fall of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.80.d: "The fall of Rome, once the heart of Western civilization and Christendom, is a sobering blow to believers across Europe. As the flames engulf Latium and the ancient city falls under the dominion of the Turks, the very soul of Christendom trembles. [Root.Monarch.GetName] leads his forces into the Papacy, met with fleeing Christian populace and priests, their desperate prayers echoing amidst the chaos.\n\nAmidst the triumphant sounds of the Mehter and the proclamations of the conquerors, the symbols of Roman heritage yield to the banners of the Turks. From the Colosseum to the Castel Sant'Angelo, the blue standard flies, bearing witness to a new order. Across Christendom, panic ensues as news of Rome's fall spreads, prompting frantic preparations for the defense of their own homelands.\n\nYet, amidst the turmoil, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds solace in the fulfillment of ancestral aspirations. Rome now bows to Turkish rule, as the conquerors set their sights further into Europe, heralding a new chapter in history."
 ab_byzantium.80.a: "All of Christendom will bow to Ahura Mazda!"

 ab_byzantium.81.t: "Epitome of Far East"
 ab_byzantium.81.d: "Far East - the easternmost region of our empire, harbors two culturally rich civilizations: the Korean scholars and the Japanese warriors. Despite their distinct histories as separate kingdoms prior to Roman rule, it is prudent to unite them under one Diocese, leveraging their shared geography and cultural affinities. However, a decision must be made regarding the capital of the Diocese, a city that will inherit the legacy of both cultures. We should choose the capital of..."
 ab_byzantium.81.a: "...the Hermit Kingdom"
 ab_byzantium.81.b: "...the Chrysanthemum Throne"

 ab_byzantium.82.t: "An Empire Across Asia"
 ab_byzantium.82.d: "With the total conquest of Asia, we now stand as the largest and most diversed empire in history. Our realm stretches from [225.GetName] to [1020.GetName], from tundra to plains, from imperial metropolises to rural villages. What's more, the four major cultural spheres: Latin, Greek, Persian, and Chinese, have all been integrated into Rome, incorporating the powers and knowledge of people from around the world. This has brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to the whole Eurasia."
 ab_byzantium.82.a: "The greatest nation on Earth"

 ab_byzantium.83.t: "Capital of the Empire"
 ab_byzantium.83.d: "Deciding the capital of our renewed nation, encompassing the legacies of the First, Second, and Third Rome, is a monumental task. Shall we maintain [Root.Capital.GetName], complementing Rome with Slavic heritage, or relocate the Imperial Throne to [151.GetName], the heart of Byzantine legacy?"
 ab_byzantium.83.a: "[Root.Capital.GetName] will mark the new era of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.83.b: "[151.GetName] is the traditional capital of Rome"

 ab_byzantium.84.t: "Romanization of Tataria"
 ab_byzantium.84.d: "Tataria, once a land of scattered tribes, now undergoes a profound transformation under the banner of Romanization. The Tatar people, long known for their nomadic ways, have begun to embrace Roman culture with remarkable fervor. It started with the ruling elite, who settled and adopted Roman customs, followed by the regional governors and common folk. Though the process will take time, they aspire to be recognized as the Romans of the Steppes - Scythicus."
 ab_byzantium.84.a: "And then the Roman culture expanded"

 ab_byzantium.86.t: "Westernization of Latin Empire"
 ab_byzantium.86.d: "After the formation of the Latin Empire, there has been a notable departure from the Illyrian heritage that once defined our nation. Instead, we find ourselves increasingly drawn to the cultural influences of the Western world. This shift is exemplified by the adoption of Francien as the official language of the royal court, signaling a clear alignment with Western customs and traditions. As we continue on this path of Westernization, we seek to solidify our position within the broader Latinsphere and embrace the values and practices that define it."
 ab_byzantium.86.a: "The reformed administration will deepen our ties with the West"

 ab_byzantium.87.t: "Restoration of West Rome"
 ab_byzantium.87.d: "With the capture of Rome and many ancient Roman territories, West Rome emerges from the turmoil of wars, rallying Christians and Latin peoples under the banner of the Eternal City once more. Yet, our mission remains unfinished. To fully restore the glory of the Roman Empire, we must extend our dominion to the Eastern provinces. The Schism still divides the Christian world, which must be united in our pursuit of the true Rome's restoration.\n\nThough some may hesitate to wage war against fellow Christians, we must recognize that our cause serves the greater good of all believers and the legacy of Rome. Let the rebirth of the Roman Phoenix inspire Europe, guiding us through the shadows of uncertainty. For the glory of Christ, the grace of the Lord, and the eternal spirit of Rome!"
 ab_byzantium.87.a: "May the dream of Rome be realized"

 ab_byzantium.88.t: "Aftermath of the Crusader"
 ab_byzantium.88.d: "The kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia stand as the last bastions of Christianity on the Iberian Peninsula, steadfast against the encroaching shadow of the Caliphate. When the heathens first swept into Visigothic lands, many attempts at resistance were futile. Yet, from the courage of Pelagius and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias arose. Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria, expanded the realm to encompass both Galicia and Asturias, but dynastic disputes later divided them. Navarra's bid for independence, led by Inigo Arista, saw success against Carolingian invaders and Muslim overlords, leading to the rise of the Jimenez Dynasty.\n\nIn 1443, Iberia suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles fell, and northern lands were scorched by Christian raiding parties. A hasty peace between the Franks and Umayyads only temporarily halted the threat of famine and renewed offensive on the frontline. Yet, for the Iberian crusaders, this peace felt like betrayal, shaking their faith and casting uncertainty on the future of the peninsula."
 ab_byzantium.88.a: "We must unite the Christians at once before Andalusia can retaliate"

 ab_byzantium.89.t: "Future of Iberia"
 ab_byzantium.89.d: "The Reconquista marks a triumphant return of many major cities in Hispania to Christian control. The support of Galicians, Asturians, Basques, and other Iberians from the South was pivotal in this success, shifting our nation's demographics and aspirations. From [227.GetName] to [213.GetName], a call for this union resonates. Some advocate for a new path, venturing westward for fortune and securing Christ's legacy in the unknown lands. Others long to reclaim our Visigothic roots in the east, aspiring to restore the glory of the fallen Western Empire of Rome."
 ab_byzantium.89.a: "We will forge a new nation for the Iberian people"
 ab_byzantium.89.b: "We will claim the legacy of Rome"

 ab_byzantium.90.t: "Iberian Reconquista"
 ab_byzantium.90.d: "Our Iberian brethren have launched a Reconquista to expel the Muslims from Hispania. With our support, their success seems inevitable."
 ab_byzantium.90.a: "Mobilize the army! We shall aid our fellow Christians in their righteous cause"
 ab_byzantium.90.b: "This matter does not concerns us"

 ab_byzantium.91.t: "Francian Support"
 ab_byzantium.91.d: "The Emperor pledges support in our war against Andalusia."
 ab_byzantium.91.a: "For Christianity!"

 ab_byzantium.92.t: "Timed Mission Unlocked"
 ab_byzantium.92.d: "We have unlocked 'The Italian League' timed mission. If we complete this mission within 5 years after being at war with the Italian League, we will unlock powerful rewards. Should we fail, the mission will be §Rpermanently removed§! from our mission tree."
 ab_byzantium.92.a: "Understood"

 ab_byzantium.93.t: "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_byzantium.93.d: "We have failed to complete 'The Italian League' timed mission, therefore the mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_byzantium.93.a: "Unfortunate"

 ab_byzantium.94.t: "Establishing Diocese"
 ab_byzantium.94.d: "Due to our recent success in military campaign, a new Diocese has been established in the conquered territories. This will help us greatly in stablizing and Romanizing the region."
 ab_byzantium.94.a: "Good to hear that"

 ab_byzantium.97.t: "Jerusalem in Christian Hands"
 ab_byzantium.97.d: "The Holy City of Jerusalem, arguably Christianity's most important city bar Rome, is now under Christian rule. As the seat of the Kings of Jerusalem since the First Crusade, the constant threat of Islamic takeovers haven't harmed the population of this fortress-city as they did with other regions of the Holy Land, at least as significantly. With our nation's banners flying from the walls and a large boost to morale, it will only be a matter of time until the rest of the Near East returns to the Christian fold. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], with the Pope's blessing, has promised to continue the reconquest of former Christian lands until not a single heathen holds rule over the Old World, much to the fanfare of the Catholics. It seems that peace won't return to the region for some time, though many are holding onto hope for us to change this perpetually."
 ab_byzantium.97.a: "The cross is triumphant once more!"

 ab_byzantium.98.t: "The Fate of Córdoba"
 ab_byzantium.98.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! We have succeeded in driving out the infidels out of the city of [225.GetName]! Our forces are patrolling the city as we speak, although, the question remains. What of the city? We have been presented with two main options. One being that we simply sack the city, save for the grand mosque which we plan on converting to a holy cathedral, important relics and libraries. Another option is to leave the city in peace and perhaps make it our capital, what would be more fitting then if we make the capital of the infidel our own? It would certainly endear us to the local populace and perhaps they may be more willing to convert to the holy faith! The choice is your my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ab_byzantium.98.a: "Let the soldiers plunder the city"
 ab_byzantium.98.b: "[225.GetName] shall become our new capital"

 ab_byzantium.99.t: "Lucius Artorius Castus"
 ab_byzantium.99.d: "Askeladd, born Lucius Artorius Castus, has finally witnessed the realization of his lifelong dream with our conquest of Denmark. The downfall of the Danish oppressors has brought a sense of fulfillment to the once cunning and ruthless Viking leader, whose life was marked by a complex struggle between his Danish and Welsh heritage.\n\nRaised by his Welsh mother on tales of the grandeur of the Brittonic legacy and the tyranny of the Danes, Askeladd's path was one of vengeance and ambition. Through a journey of deceit, strategy, and unyielding will, he played a pivotal role in weakening Danish power from within. Now, with Denmark under Brittonic rule, his vision has been achieved.\n\nIn this newfound era, Askeladd pledges unwavering loyalty to our court. His strategic mind, honed through years of conflict and survival, is now at our disposal. He stands ready to serve, driven by a desire to honor his mother's wishes and to secure the future of his people under our reign. His legacy, once forged in vengeance, now transforms into one of service and devotion, promising to be a cornerstone of our rule in these newly conquered lands."
 ab_byzantium.99.a: "The man can use his experience of combat to serve the court"
 ab_byzantium.99.b: "The man can use his experience of combat to lead our army"
 ab_byzantium.99.c: "Such a man cannot be bound to servitude! How about exploring the new lands for us?"

 ab_byzantium.100.t: "The Third Rome"
 ab_byzantium.100.d: "Our soldiers parade into the newly christened city of [151.GetName], formerly Constantinople, in celebration of the heroic victories that have led to this moment. With this new conquest, [Root.GetName] will be seen in the eyes of the world as the true Third Rome!\n\nAll that remains is to decide on the capital of our renewed nation; shall it remain in the great city of [Root.Capital.GetName], or shall we relocate the court to [151.GetName]?"
 ab_byzantium.100.a: "[151.GetName] shall be our capital!"
 ab_byzantium.100.b: "[Root.Capital.GetName] shall be made even more glorious!"

 ab_byzantium.102.t: "No cheating"
 ab_byzantium.102.d: "You cannot use the modifiers used to strengthen AIs"
 ab_byzantium.102.a: "Understood"

 ab_byzantium.105.t: "A Roman Alliance"
 ab_byzantium.105.d: "In the grand tapestry of history, two mighty nations proclaim themselves heirs of Rome: [Root.GetName] and [targetTriumvir.GetName]. Both seek to restore the borders of the ancient empire, driven by a shared vision of glory and resurgence. Yet, their paths are fraught with formidable adversaries, each obstructing their quest for dominance.\n\nIn this crucial moment, the wisdom of our forebears beckons us to consider a temporary alliance with them. By setting aside our differences and uniting our strengths, we can overcome the obstacles that stand in our way. An alliance between the heirs of Rome, forged in the spirit of mutual ambition, may be the key to achieving our common goal - the restoration of the empire's former magnificence."
 ab_byzantium.105.a: "Let's settle our differences for the common goal"
 ab_byzantium.105.b: "There is no chance we would cooperate with them"

 ab_byzantium.107.t: "The Third Triumvirate"
 ab_byzantium.107.d: "As the embers of our alliance with [otherTriumvir.GetName] ignite, another power reveals a shared dream - [targetTriumvir.GetName]. Their ambition mirrors our own, desiring the restoration of Rome's former glory. With interest piqued by our pact with [otherTriumvir.GetName], they now also seeks to join our ranks. The proposal to form a Third Triumvirate echoes through the annals of history, recalling the legendary alliance of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus.\n\nBy accepting [targetTriumvir.GetName] into our fold, we can forge an alliance that spans the breadth of Europe, combining our resources, military might, and strategic acumen. This triumvirate would stand as a beacon of unity and strength, a coalition of heirs dedicated to the resurgence of Rome's former glory. We can strive together to reclaim the splendor of the ancient empire, continuing the legacy of Augustus. The future of Europe hangs in the balance, and with this alliance, we have the opportunity to shape it in our image."
 ab_byzantium.107.a: "We should invite them"
 ab_byzantium.107.b: "Two of us are already enough"

 ab_byzantium.108.t: "The Third Triumvirate"
 ab_byzantium.108.d: "In a moment of profound significance, we have received an invitation from [From.GetName] and [otherTriumvir.GetName]. These two great powers, recognizing our shared ambition and strength, seek to form a triumvirate reminiscent of Rome's storied past. The proposal is compelling: a united front of three mighty nations, each dedicated to the restoration of the Roman Empire's borders and glory. Joining forces with those two offers an unprecedented opportunity to shape the future of Europe, combining our strengths and resources in pursuit of a common goal. This alliance, a modern echo of the legendary partnership of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, promises to bring stability and power. As [Root.GetName], we stand at the threshold of a new era, one where our influence and legacy can be cemented alongside our esteemed allies. The path ahead is clear, and the promise of the Third Triumvirate beckons us to greatness."
 ab_byzantium.108.a: "We would gladly accept"
 ab_byzantium.108.b: "On the second thought, this alliance seems ridiculous"

 ab_byzantium.110.t: "Collapse of the Triumvirate"
 ab_byzantium.110.d: "With the borders of Rome nearly reclaimed, the purpose of our triumvirate has waned. What once united us now serves as a reminder of our inevitable rivalry. The alliance, forged in ambition and shared goals, has become obsolete.\n\nThe tension between us grows daily. Each nation eyes the others with suspicion, knowing that the time to turn against former allies is near. To protect ourselves and ensure our dominance, it is justified to strike first. The dream of a united Rome gives way to the harsh reality of power and survival. The triumvirate collapses, and the stage is set for a new era of conflict."
 ab_byzantium.110.a: "The Imperial Throne shall be mine!"

 ab_byzantium.112.t: "Visitors from the East"
 ab_byzantium.112.d: "A remarkable group of scholars, fleeing turmoil in the Far East, has sought refuge at our court. These learned men follow the Zunist faith, preaching the ancient teachings of the Sun God, which strikingly mirror the revered beliefs of Rome before the advent of Christianity. Their doctrines have piqued the curiosity of Robert XI, the Mad Duke, who is now captivated by the prospect of rediscovering and integrating this forgotten wisdom.\n\nRobert's fascination grows as he explores the forbidden knowledge of these eastern scholars, seeing in it the potential to revive a powerful and unified faith. By incorporating the core tenets of Zunism with the sacred values of Christianity, he envisions the creation of Sol Invictus, a hybrid religion that could solidify our claim as the legitimate successors of Rome. This vision echoes the legacy of Emperor Aurelian, who once championed the worship of the Unconquered Sun to unify the empire. Reviving this ancient tradition and blending it with Christianity could strengthen our spiritual foundation and elevate our political stature, reaffirming our place as heirs to the great Roman legacy."
 ab_byzantium.112.a: "Nonsense! Rome is dead long time ago"
 ab_byzantium.112.b: "It sounds interesting..."

 ab_byzantium.113.t: "Reform Our Court"
 ab_byzantium.113.d: "Rome cannot be rebuilt by one man alone; it requires a band of talented and dedicated individuals. To achieve our grand vision, we will reform our court by enlisting men who share our goals and aspirations. Together, with a united and capable council, we will restore the glory of Rome and lead our nation to greatness."
 ab_byzantium.113.a: "Let's us begin our reformation"

 ab_byzantium.114.t: "Restore the Roman Bureaucracy"
 ab_byzantium.114.d: "To prepare for our grand reconquest of the ancient territories, we must restore the bureaucracy of old Rome. This system, renowned for its efficiency and order, will enable us to manage a vast empire once more. By combining this structured administration with the divine guidance of Sol Invictus, we forge a state capable of great feats. Let the revival of the Roman Bureaucracy be the cornerstone of our ambitions, ensuring our dominion over the lands of our ancestors."
 ab_byzantium.114.a: "It is time to topple the rule of the Catholics!"

 ab_byzantium.115.t: "A Sol Invictus Kingdom"
 ab_byzantium.115.d: "For far too long, the Pope has kept us in chains, perpetuating the Christian frauds who claim to be the successors of Rome. We are weary of their lies and deceit. It is time to show the world who the true heirs of Rome are. Under the banner of Sol Invictus, we will rise and reclaim the Eternal City for ourselves, restoring the glory and power of our ancient heritage."
 ab_byzantium.115.a: "Down with the false Christians!"

 ab_byzantium.116.t: "Dream of Rome"
 ab_byzantium.116.d: "Having taken Roma, our campaign is far from over. Italia lies before us, sullied by the so-called Italians of the Holy Roman Empire who have desecrated this sacred land. We shall cleanse their filth and restore the homeland of Rome to its former glory. Our dream of a resurgent Rome, proud and powerful, drives us forward. The legacy of the ancient empire will be reborn through our conquest and determination."
 ab_byzantium.116.a: "Our reconquest, is just begin"

 ab_byzantium.117.t: "The Mad Emperor"
 ab_byzantium.117.d: "Robert the Mad Duke has achieved what many deemed impossible, conquering the entirety of Italia within his lifetime - a feat not seen since the days of Justinian. With this monumental triumph, he has proclaimed himself Emperor of the Romans, declaring his ambition to reconquer the lost territories of the ancient empire. Under his rule, the dream of a restored Rome ignites once more, as Robert sets his sights on reclaiming the glory of the past. From now on, he should be known as the Mad Emperor."
 ab_byzantium.117.a: "Such a cool nickname for me"

 ab_byzantium.118.t: "Death of the Emperor"
 ab_byzantium.118.d: "The death of Emperor Robert has plunged Rome into chaos. The Italians, recently subjugated, have risen in rebellion, threatening the stability of our empire. The situation is dire, with the very foundations of our realm trembling. Yet, in this time of crisis, we turn to Sol Invictus for guidance. The divine light shall lead us through the darkness, and with faith and resolve, we shall overcome these trials and restore order to our empire."
 ab_byzantium.118.a: "No time for grieving. We must end those petty rebellions"

 ab_byzantium.119.t: "The Key to Immortality"
 ab_byzantium.119.d: "As Emperor Robert ages, the fear of instability and chaos looms over the empire. In this time of uncertainty, a glimmer of hope emerges from the East. Zunist scholars, renowned for their mystical knowledge, claim to possess a rare medicine capable of prolonging life. They bring tales of ancient remedies and elixirs, promising to extend the Emperor’s reign and maintain stability in our realm. The prospect of immortality and continued leadership under Robert's wise rule offers a beacon of hope amidst the growing shadows."
 ab_byzantium.119.a: "Robert will lead us to greatness!"

 ab_byzantium.120.t: "To Pay the Price"
 ab_byzantium.120.d: "The medicine that once seemed like a miracle now reveals its temporary nature. To prolong his life, Emperor Robert requires more of it. However, this time the scholars demand a greater price. Instead of offering it freely, they now ask for substantial resources, pushing the empire to make difficult choices. The future of our emperor and our realm hangs in the balance as we weigh the costs of this precious elixir."
 ab_byzantium.120.a: "Everything will do to prolong our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reign"

However, despite our rightful claim as the successors of Rome, the West still views us as merely the Empire of the Greeks. To rectify this perception, the bureaucracy must undergo reforms that blend both Latin and Greek values.\n\nYet, as plans for this overhaul unfold, an unforeseen catastrophe strikes. A colossal asteroid crashes into Mount Thera, triggering a catastrophic eruption that blankets the Aegean Sea in darkness and ash. This event marks the onset of what will come to be known as the Crisis of the Sixteenth Century."

Peace, hard-won and dearly cherished, now reigns after a tumultuous struggle that threatened to fracture the empire. But true to their legacy, the Romans endure, unbowed by the trials that beset them. Peasants, Muslims, and Italians alike found themselves unable to halt the inexorable march of Roman resilience.\n\nYet, amidst this respite, a daunting challenge remains. The scars of relentless warfare have left our economy battered and bruised, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the path to recovery. Still, even in the aftermath of crisis, there flickers a glimmer of hope - a beacon heralding the eventual return of prosperity and light to the empire."

In a desperate plea for aid, merchants and traders beseech the Treasury for financial assistance to begin the arduous task of rebuilding.\n\nIn response to this urgent call to action, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must weigh the options before them, deliberating on the allocation of resources to mend the shattered economy. Their decision will shape the fate of Byzantium in the tumultuous days ahead."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.17.a: "We will do everything for the reconstruction"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.17.b: "We will do something to fix the damage"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.17.c: "We will do nothing"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.18.t: "Language of the Romans"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.18.d: "The schism that cleaved the Roman Empire into East and West has left an indelible mark on our cultural landscape. For centuries, Greek has reigned as the lingua franca of the Eastern half, shaping our traditions and identity. Yet, the prospect of reclaiming the Western Empire presents a tantalizing opportunity to revive Latin as the language of unity.\n\nHowever, such a move may stir discontent among the [Root.GetNobilityName], who have long embraced Greek as their own. To navigate this delicate balance, we must consider a compromise that accommodates both languages, fostering harmony and inclusivity within our united Roman Empire.\n\nWhat will it be, my liege? Shall we embark on this journey of linguistic revival, or tread cautiously to preserve the delicate equilibrium of our realm?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.18.a: "We must return to our Latin roots"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.18.b: "Both Latin and Greek will be our co-official languages"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.18.c: "We embrace the Greek heritage"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.19.t: "Restoration of the Republic"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.19.d: "Amidst the chaos of the disaster, a figure rises from the masses: Ioannis Kapodistrias. He rallies support from peasants and merchants alike, advocating for a return to the Republic of old. Their demand is clear: power to the common folk, governance by the people of Rome.\n\nShould we accede to their demands, the [Root.GetBurghersName] will seize control of the Senate, paving the way for the restoration of the Republic upon the formation of Rome. But beware, my liege, for every action may have far-reaching consequences. What shall be our course of action?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.19.a: "This is nonsense!"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.19.b: "The age of imperial rule has come to an end. I should hand over power to the people"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.20.t: "[Root.GetNobilityName] Deal"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.20.d: "The Anatolian nobles, long observers of the unfolding drama, have finally revealed their scheme. Sensing our vulnerability, they make their demands clear: claiming greater autonomy and authority, or face the Anatolian wrath.\n\nTheir ultimatum presents a precarious choice. Should we acquiesce to their demands, we risk further erosion of central authority and the empowerment of regional magnates. Yet, a refusal could provoke open rebellion, plunging the empire into deeper turmoil.\n\nWhat shall be our response to this brazen challenge, my liege?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.20.a: "We need every help to fight against this crisis..."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.20.b: "Perhaps I could reach an agreement with some of you"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.20.c: "No deal at all! Death to the traitors!"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.21.t: "Ayyubids Revolt"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.21.d: "My liege, troubling tidings reach our ears once more. A Muslim leader, laying claim to the legacy of the Ayyubids, has ignited rebellion in the Levant. In a few short months, they have clandestinely gathered forces from among our newly subdued Muslim subjects.\n\nWe stand at a critical juncture. Swift and decisive action is imperative to quell this uprising before it engulfs the entire Levant in flames. Shall we muster our forces and crush this threat with all haste, my liege?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.21.a: "Levant is rightfully ours!"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.21.b: "We cannot deal with them right now"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.22.t: "Palestine Joins Ayyubids"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.22.d: "Our suspicions were not unfounded, my liege. The Muslims of Palestine, nursing grievances from our conquest of Jerusalem, have indeed thrown their support behind the Ayyubids' revolt. Their animosity towards our rule has emboldened the rebellion and swelled its ranks."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.22.a: "They must be stopped"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.23.t: "Lower Egypt Joins Ayyubids"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.23.d: "The flames of rebellion spread even further, my liege. Alexandria, once under the sway of the Nizzarids, has now thrown its lot in with the Ayyubids, joining their cause to overthrow our rule in the Levant."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.23.a: "We must crush them before the revolt spreads to all of Egypt"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.24.t: "Upper Egypt Join Ayyubids"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.24.d: "The flames of rebellion spread uncontrollably, my liege. With our inability to swiftly quell the revolt, the remaining regions of Egypt have now joined forces with the Ayyubids."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.24.a: "No mercy to the traitors!"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.25.t: "Defeat of the Ayyubids"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.25.d: "With the capitulation of the Ayyubids, the Eastern Front has been pacified, and their territories are once again under our sway. It is imperative that we take swift action to reintegrate these regions into our realm and ensure that such rebellions do not arise again."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.25.a: "Harsh treatment is needed to be done"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.26.t: "Italian League Leader"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.26.d: "The strategy of supporting the peasant and Muslim revolts in Byzantium has proven successful, thus weakening our adversary from within. The role of leader of the Italian League, who shall demand Italy from the false Christians, is offered to us, presenting both opportunities and risks."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.26.a: "No other nation is more suitable than us"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.26.b: "The others should lead us"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.27.t: "An Italian Ultimatum"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.27.d: "The machinations of our foes have been unveiled: it is the Italians who covet our hard-won territories in Italy for themselves. They assert that Italy should be reserved for 'the true Christians', yet they lack the courage to confront the Sicilian Emirate directly, resorting instead to underhanded tactics of supporting rebels to undermine our strength. Now that they have brazenly demanded Italy from us, we cannot let this moment pass without delivering a resounding blow to crush the ambitions of the Italians once and for all!"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.27.a: "We shall swiftly demonstrate the error in their thinking!"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.27.b: "We cannot fight the might of the united Italian League..."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.28.t: "Byzantium Refused Ultimatum"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.28.d: "The League Leader has summoned us to join forces in the noble cause of reclaiming Italy for the true Christian faith. We shall answer this call with unwavering resolve."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.28.a: "To war!"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.28.b: "We should sit this one out"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.29.t: "The Italian League War Against Byzantium"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.29.d: "The Italians have banded together in a coalition, audaciously demanding Italy from Byzantium. While this matter ostensibly concerns them alone, they remain technically under the jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire. Recognizing an opportunity to bolster our coffers, we shall demand a bribe from Byzantium, ensuring that we abstain from joining the war as protectors of our Italian subjects."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.29.a: "Who would refuse easy money?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.29.b: "I do not want to provoke them"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.30.t: "[From.GetName] Requests Bribe"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.30.d: "Recognizing an opportunity for swift profit, the Holy Roman Emperor has requested a bribe from us to refrain from joining the war on the side of the Italians."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.30.a: "We cannot allow them to become embroiled in this conflict."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.30.b: "They want our money? Over our dead bodies!"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.31.t: "Defeat of the Italians"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.31.d: "Despite their attempts to weaken us through supporting rebellions and forming coalitions, Rome remains resolute. The collective strength of the Italians pales in comparison to the might of the Roman army. With the Italians now significantly weakened, the opportunity to reclaim Italy for Rome has presented itself. We must make ready for further conquests in Northern Italy."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.31.a: "Never dare to challenge the might of Rome"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.32.t: "Peace with the Italians"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.32.d: "After over a decade of relentless conflict with no decisive victor in sight, vast swathes of Italian cities and towns lie in ruins. Recognizing the impossibility of sustaining the war effort further, both sides have reluctantly agreed to a ceasefire. The terms stipulate a restoration of borders to their pre-war state and the disbandment of the Italian League. We shall seize this opportunity to regroup and rebuild our forces."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.32.a: "Next time it will not be a stalemate"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.33.t: "Ayyubids Victory"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.33.d: "With our failure to suppress the Ayyubids' revolt, all of our territories in the Levant have fallen under their control. Faced with the reality of an insurmountable challenge, the war in the East has concluded. Decades of painstaking reconquests have been nullified; all that we fought to reclaim has now slipped from our grasp."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.33.a: "This cannot be happening..."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.34.t: "The Italian League Victory"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.34.d: "Unable to safeguard our domains in Italy, we are compelled to relinquish all our provinces in Italy in exchange for peace. The dream of Roman Italy may now be lost to us forever."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.34.a: "This cannot be happening..."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.35.t: "[118.GetName] Sieged"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.35.d: "We must take back [118.GetName]. If we cannot do it in 2 years, we will §Rinstantly lose§!."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.37.d: "Many have held the belief that Roman culture embodies a monolithic society. However, [ROM.GetName] serves as the cradle of diverse major cultural spheres, all united under the banner of Rome with equal rights and influence. Maintaining equilibrium among these factions is a solemn responsibility we bear. Unfortunately, we have faltered in this duty. Feeling betrayed by our mismanagement, the discontented populace has risen in revolt."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.37.a: "Force is now our only resolution"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.38.t: "Agreement Reached"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.38.d: "After years of conflict, our cultural spheres have finally reached a settlement to end their strife.

It is imperative that we take measures to prevent its recurrence."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.63.d: "The Grand Diocese is indeed under the direct rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, its autonomy far surpasses that of other Dioceses.

 #Persian War

 ab_byzantium_disaster.71.t: "The Persian War"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.71.d: "The Roman Empire stood unparalleled in history. From the northern reaches of Britain to the deserts of the Sahara, and from the shores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Euphrates, it enforced peace and prosperity on an unprecedented scale. Its sole rival lay in the East, where the Parthians and later the Sassanids presided over great cities and trade routes to enigmatic lands beyond. This was the realm Alexander the Great had traversed, igniting a vision of glory and conquest that captivated Greeks and Romans alike. The legendary rivalry between the ancient world's two superpowers is etched into the annals of history.\n\nNow, as our empire rises from the ashes, so too do the Persians, particularly following our conquest of their ancient capital, Ctesiphon. Tensions mount along our shared border, evoking memories of the Roman-Persian Wars that spanned centuries. The drain on resources during these protracted conflicts proved calamitous for both empires, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable. Seizing advantage of our weakened state, the Rashidun armies swiftly seized Roman territories in the Orient and Africa. Determined not to repeat past mistakes, we must endeavor to bring an end to this conflict once and for all, be it through diplomacy or the annihilation of Persia."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.74.d: "The Roman Empire has harbored long-standing desires for our lands. Stretching from the northern reaches of Britain to the Sahara, and from the Atlantic coast to the Euphrates, their appetite for conquest knows no bounds, as evidenced by their numerous wars against us. This was the very region Alexander the Great had swept through, igniting a vision of glory and conquest that captivated Greeks and Romans alike. The epic rivalry between the ancient world's two great superpowers is a legendary tale immortalized in history books.\n\nNow that our empire has risen from the ashes, so too have the Romans, particularly following their conquest of our ancient capital, Ctesiphon. Tensions mount along our shared border, sparking fears of a resurgence of the Roman-Persian War after centuries. The drain on resources during the prolonged Roman-Persian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires, leaving us exhausted and vulnerable. Seizing advantage of our weakened state, the Rashidun armies swiftly seized Roman territories in the Orient and Africa. Intent on learning from past mistakes, the Romans seek to bring an end to this conflict once and for all, whether through diplomacy or the total destruction of our empire."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.80.t: "A Chance for Reconciliation?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.80.d: "Nations in the East have all geared up for the impending conflict of unprecedented scale. Initially, we were poised to send Rome an ultimatum, demanding Caucasia and Mesopotamia. However, upon considering the sheer devastation and ruin that the war would inflict upon both titans, the Shahanshah of Persia has contemplated stepping back. We can offer Rome a pact that could bring an end to the age-old, futile rivalry between our two great powers. Perhaps, by forging a strategic partnership, we can jointly safeguard stability along our shared borders, designating Caucasia and Mesopotamia as buffer zones."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.80.a: "We should avoid bloodshed. Offer them a truce"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.80.b: "Yield to our demands, or face war!"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.81.t: "Persia Ultimatum"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.81.d1: "Persia has issued an ultimatum: we must relinquish any ambitions of eastern conquest and surrender Mesopotamia and Caucasia to them. Refusal will prompt the Coalition of the East to unleash their combined might against us, thwarting Roman expansion. However, the Shahanshah of Persia acknowledges the futility of our rivalry and endless disputes. As such, they propose a strategic partnership, suggesting the establishment of Caucasia and Mesopotamia as buffer zones between our empires."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.81.d2: "Persia has issued an ultimatum: we must relinquish any ambitions of eastern conquest and surrender Mesopotamia and Caucasia to them. Refusal will prompt the Coalition of the East to unleash their combined might against us, thwarting Roman expansion."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.82.d: "With our inability to defend the Levant against Persian forces, all of our territories in the region have capitulated to them.

 ab_byzantium_disaster.82.a: "This cannot be happening..."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.83.t: "Dioceses in Persia"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.83.d: "The heartlands of the Persian Empire have succumbed to our formidable legions. The wealth of Persia, its renowned Great Cities, and the dominance of the East now lie within our grasp. However, the integration of these territories would require time and strain our already overextended administration. It would be prudent to allow the Dioceses to govern Persia on our behalf, with the possibility of annexation in the future."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.83.b: "Persia is better off under Diocese rule"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.84.t: "Attrition War"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.88.d: "Despite being separated by thousands of miles, the two world superpowers, Rome and China, have been aware of each other's existence since the time of Emperor Augustus. Our predecessors referred to them as Sinae or Serica, the land of silk - and in return, we were known as Daqin by the Chinese. While the two empires are too distant to establish official diplomatic relations, traders and envoys have traversed the great distance between them throughout history.\n\nHowever, change is on the horizon. The expansionist [ROM.GetName], encroaching upon China's borders, especially after news of the fall of the Persian Empire at the hands of the Romans reached the Dragon Throne, has made the Dragon Emperor realize that they may soon become the next target of Roman expansion.

While the two empires are too distant to establish official diplomatic relations, traders and envoys have traversed the great distance between them throughout history.\n\nHowever, change is on the horizon. The expansionist [ROM.GetName], encroaching upon our borders, especially after news of the fall of the Persian Empire at the hands of the Romans reached the Dragon Throne, has made the Dragon Emperor realize that we may soon become the next target of Roman conquests. We must fortify our defenses at all costs, as Rome seeks to destroy our legacy for good. The Chinese Dragon and the Roman Phoenix - only one can emerge victorious."

 ab_byzantium_disaster.91.t: "Dioceses Refuse to Join"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.91.d: "The invasion of China would demand hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of manpower and an equivalent amount of resources from the entire empire.

 ab_byzantium_disaster.94.d: "The Grand Diocese, spanning from the Baltic Sea to Siberia, is undoubtedly our strongest and most loyal subject, capable of securing our victory against the Dragon Emperor. However, their involvement also poses a significant threat: despite their size, the majority of their population is concentrated in Europe, leaving much of their shared border with China undefended. Moreover, the Chinese Emperor has long coveted these lands and would undoubtedly seize them if given the chance. My liege, should we request their assistance in the war?"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.94.a: "We can defeat the Emperor before he poses a threat to our subject territory"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.94.b: "The risk is too great. It would be better for them to stay out of the campaign"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.95.t: "An Offer From The Steppes"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.95.d: "News of the impending war between the two world superpowers has reached the court of the Great Khan. The people of the steppes have always coveted the riches of China, and numerous raids have been conducted, albeit with limited success due to the heavily fortified border. However, they now see an opportunity for a grand distraction, one that could draw the Imperial Army away from the Great Wall. Sensing the moment is ripe, the Great Khan has pledged allegiance to us in the war, with the condition that they may claim any land they manage to seize from China and receive some 'investments' from us to aid in prolonging their war effort."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.95.a: "The horde would secure our northern flank"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.95.b: "China is ours and ours alone to claim"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.96.t: "Japanese Alliance"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.96.d: "The Japanese Archipelago, united under the Empire of Japan, has long harbored ambitions to expand beyond their islands, particularly westward to the Korean Peninsula. However, their aspirations have been stymied by Korea's protection under the Emperor of China, thwarting any attempts by the ambitious Japanese to conquer the peninsula. This status quo has persisted for years, but it hasn't deterred Japan from seeking a solution to break free from it. They recognize the need for an ally in the west to flank China from both sides, thus enabling them to defeat Korea before any reinforcements from the Dragon Emperor arrive. Now, with this opportunity at hand, Japan has dispatched envoys to us, proposing an alliance. However, they demand that any land they seize in Korea and coastal Chinese provinces will be theirs to claim. Furthermore, they seek our assistance in their modernization efforts by sharing any technological advancements we possess."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.96.a: "We have a deal"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.96.b: "Get lost. We do not need you"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.97.t: "Korean Participation"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.97.d: "Japan has openly declared their involvement in the Roman invasion of China, with the goal of seizing the Korean Peninsula for themselves. Faced with no other option, the Koreans have aligned themselves with the Emperor of China for protection."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.97.a: "Our ally should handle them"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.98.t: "The Invasion Begins"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.98.d: "After a year of meticulous preparations and diplomatic maneuvering, the stage is now set for a monumental event in history. It is a moment that surpasses even the legendary invasion of Persia, as the mighty Roman legions prepare to embark on a journey of unprecedented scale and ambition. From the heart of Europe to the distant shores of China, they march with unwavering determination, joined by our steadfast allies from the East."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.98.a: "The Dragon Throne shall crumble before the might of Rome!"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.99.t: "The Fall of China"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.99.d: "The age-old rivalry between the Phoenix of the West and the Dragon of the East has reached its climax. Roman legions march triumphantly through the once-proud lands of the Dragon Emperor, their banners fluttering over the soil of the Middle Kingdom. The might of Rome has brought about the total collapse of China and the annihilation of the Mandate of Heaven. However, to subjugate this fractured empire now would be a reckless endeavor. Across the land, regional warlords have risen, each seeking to carve out their own domain from the remnants of the fallen empire, like vultures descending upon a carcass. For now, it is prudent to refrain from further entanglement and to await a more opportune moment to assert Rome's dominance over these lands."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.99.a: "Even the Son of Heaven stands no chance against Rome"

 ab_byzantium_disaster.101.t: "The Dragon Survives"
 ab_byzantium_disaster.101.d: "Despite the relentless onslaught from [ROM.GetName] and their allies, China remains unconquered. The war has raged on for a decade, claiming millions of lives on both sides. Recognizing the futility of further conflict, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has made the difficult decision to halt the invasion. The Roman Phoenix, once invincible, now bears the sting of defeat at the hands of the indomitable Dragon."
 ab_byzantium_disaster.101.a: "This shame will linger like a stain upon our honor..."

#Nicaea
 ab_nicaea.8.t: "Rebirth of Hellenism - Culture"
 ab_nicaea.8.d: "We have torn down their statues, stripped them of power and wealth, and every day we strive to reverse the Romanization of Greece. Yet, despite our efforts and our disdain for the Empire, our fury remains unquenched. The crimes of Rome against Hellas are countless, but perhaps the most insidious is the indoctrination of Greeks into the Roman identity. As time passes, we seek ever more radical solutions to purge ourselves of this Latin disease, yet it seems our efforts are never enough to truly purify Greece in the eyes of our ancestors.\n\nIn recent years, a radical faction has emerged within our court, advocating for an extreme solution: to completely sever ties with the Byzantine Greek culture and restore the Hellenic culture of the pre-Roman era. This audacious idea finds support among the Great Houses, and so the ancient Hellenic culture is reborn in [Root.GetName], beginning from the city of [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 ab_nicaea.8.a: "A true Greek culture, untainted by the influence of greedy Romans"

 ab_nicaea.12.t: "Antigonid Magna Graecia"
 ab_nicaea.12.d: "Back in antiquity, Southern Italia gleamed as the jewel of the Mediterranean Sea. Numerous thriving Greek cities flourished in the region, forming what became known as Magna Graecia - a name bestowed by the Romans, who coveted the wealth and prosperity of our people. Yet, this land could not escape the grasp of Roman conquests, and many of its once-prosperous cities, such as Syracuse, were left devastated, mere shadows of their former glory.\n\nCenturies passed, the land has changed hands multiple times until falling under the dominion of the Hafsids. But today, Magna Graecia has returned to Hellenic rule. We shall establish a local government, with the Great House Antigonos at its helm. Together, we will restore Magna Graecia to its rightful place of glory and splendor."
 ab_nicaea.12.a: "This will firmly establish our rule over Italia"

 ab_nicaea.13.t: "Seleucid Kingdom"
 ab_nicaea.13.d: "Among all of Alexander's Diadochi Kingdoms, none can rival the strength and success of the Seleucid Kingdom of Nikator. Rising to the status of an empire in its own right, it stands as the first Helleno-Persian empire in history, capable even of challenging the mighty Mauryan Empire.\n\nDuring its golden age, the Seleucid Kingdom witnessed the zenith of Hellenic culture, traditions, and values, extending its influence to the distant lands of India and even China.\n\nWith the fall of Persia, the Great House Seleukos now seeks to reclaim their ancient kingdom, starting with our recently conquered lands in Mesopotamia and Persia."
 ab_nicaea.13.a: "The Persians will thrive under our administration"

 ab_nicaea.16.d: "The entire empire teeters on the brink of collapse. Following the mysterious death of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], occurring shortly after the tragic demise of his heir in a purported road accident. Some whisper of foreign powers' involvement, while others insist that the Great Houses are behind the tragedy.\n\nWith no suitable heir from the Royal House to ascend the throne, a general from the house of Parmelion has been appointed as the Supreme Regent. This move aims to thwart any attempts by the Great Houses to seize power for themselves. While welcomed by many generals and nobles, this decision has sparked outrage among the Great Houses, prompting them to reveal their true intentions.\n\nIt is unveiled that the assassinations were orchestrated by the Great Houses, and now, unable to claim the throne directly, they have mobilized their supporters across the empire to wage war against their rivals.\n\nThe entire Hellenic world is engulfed in conflict, as factions vie for dominance. Soon, a new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be crowned from the house of..."

Henceforth, they shall govern over a unified and centralized Hellenic Empire, having eradicated all political adversaries. A new era dawns for the descendants of Mother Hellas."
 ab_nicaea.17.a: "The Hellenic world now bends to our will alone"

 ab_nicaea.19.t: "Swaying Supporters"
 ab_nicaea.19.d: "The factions of our empire proved to be a pain to manage. By direct intervention, we could sway the citizens of [From.GetName] to support other Great Houses. Which one should we choose?"

 ab_punic.1.d: "After the devastating Second Punic War, Carthage faced inevitable demise. To ensure a brighter future for the Punic people, the illustrious Hannibal Barca embarked on an expedition to the distant west, far from the clutches of Roman ambition. Under Hannibal's brilliant leadership, the children of Carthage achieved the impossible and discovered a land to settle on the new continent.\n\nOver many generations, the Punics have thrived, establishing themselves as economic powerhouses in the new world through trade and peaceful coexistence with the native peoples."
 ab_punic.1.a: "No one can compete with us on this continent"

 ab_punic.3.t: "Discovery of the New World"
 ab_punic.3.d: "Venturing beyond the horizon, our intrepid explorers have set foot on a vast, uncharted land. Rich in resources and teeming with diverse peoples, this New World presents unparalleled opportunities for glory and wealth. The discovery heralds a new chapter in our history, one of expansion, conquest, and cultural exchange. As our flag waves over this newfound territory, we embark on an era that will redefine our nation's destiny and the course of history itself. The age of exploration dawns, promising untold prosperity and unrivaled power."
 ab_punic.3.a: "We shall send our men to settle on this continent"

 ab_punic.4.t: "A Strange Yet Familiar World"
 ab_punic.4.d1: "Our first encounter with the local republic defied our expectations; the cities here are more advanced than we anticipated, though still not on par with our own. Their language, intriguingly similar to Greek, facilitated our communication. Even more surprising was their retention of a slavery system akin to those of ancient empires. Eager to learn more, we discovered that their ancestors were the natives who had embraced Hellenic civilization through the teachings of Sosylus of Lacedaemon, one of the loyal advisors of the hero Hannibal who has fled to this land, fleeing destruction from Rome. Could it be that the Punic people, thought to be extinct, sought refuge here and imparted their knowledge and ideology to these inhabitants? The possibility ignites our curiosity and admiration for this enigmatic civilization."
 ab_punic.4.d2: "Upon our arrival, we encountered a local republic whose cities exceeded our expectations in both development and sophistication. Though not yet matching our grandeur, their civilization displayed a surprising advancement. Remarkably, their language bore similarities to Semitic tongues, easing our communication. Even more astonishing was their continued practice of slavery, reminiscent of ancient empires.\n\nIntrigued by their origins, we learned that they claim descent from the legendary hero Hannibal, who had his face put on the local coins and statues raised everywhere, having journeyed to this continent which they named 'Buniq' long ago to escape annihilation. Could these be the fabled Punic people, thought to be lost to history? The possibility stirs our curiosity and reverence for this newfound discovery."

Because of that, we call them the 'Palemen'.\n\nAlthough this is the first time we met, they had no trouble communicating, finding our language 'somewhat familiar to those on their continent'.\n\nThey shared tales of their homeland, filled with constant warfare and strange religions. Intrigued by their stories, we also revealed our origins, recounting the tale of the hero Hannibal and his legendary journey to this continent a long time ago. Upon learning our origin, they seemed very surprised, believing the Punics extinct at the hands of Rome. Hearing the name of Hannibal's nemesis from them and knowing its legacy still alive makes us uneasy. But, we should keep this to ourselves for now.\n\nEager to befriend us, they have shown great interest in our culture, gifting us with many things we have never seen before. In return, they request a map of our trade league, marking the beginning of a potential alliance."

This intricate web of commerce showcases their remarkable prosperity. Perhaps we can become their trade partner, reaping the benefits of their wealth. Or, we might wait for the opportune moment to take these riches for ourselves..."
 ab_punic.6.a: "This map is such a huge help to us!"

 ab_punic.7.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Gifts"
 ab_punic.7.d: "Despite our earnest offerings, [From.GetName] remains reticent to exchange their invaluable trade map for our gifts. As outsiders in the matters of this continent, it is clear that we must invest time and effort to better understand their culture and earn their trust through means beyond material wealth."
 ab_punic.7.a: "Oh well, at least we tried"

 ab_punic.8.t: "Visitors Beyond the Sea"
 ab_punic.8.d: "Rumors spread quickly across the continent of an unexpected exchange between [discoveredCountry_NA.GetName] and the distant nation of [discoveredCountry_EU.GetName] who comes from another continent called Europe. From what we were told, their skin is so pale as if they are sick. Because of that, they are refered as the 'Palemen' by [discoveredCountry_NA.GetName]. While the interaction reportedly ended on good terms, uncertainties about their intentions linger amidst tales of a great continent rife with constant wars and mysterious religions have intrigued us, stirring a mix of curiosity and caution. We can only hope that these visitors from beyond the seas bring opportunities rather than harm."
 ab_punic.8.a: "We may soon witness changes to this continent"

 ab_punic.9.t: "A Strange Yet Familiar World"
 ab_punic.9.d: "Word has swiftly spread across Europe of an unprecedented exchange between [discoveredCountry_EU.GetName] and the faraway republic of [discoveredCountry_NA.GetName] in the continent of Buniq. Stories of untold riches and the elusive claimant of the local people to be descendants of Hannibal, who rumored to have fled to the distant continent centuries ago, have captivated our imaginations. Legends whisper of vast treasures hidden in uncharted lands, waiting to be discovered by bold adventurers and daring explorers, sparking a newfound interest in the possibilities beyond the seas. The promise of exotic goods and untapped markets heralds an era of potential prosperity and expansion for our realm, as we eagerly anticipate the unfolding opportunities in this strange yet strangely familiar world."
 ab_punic.9.a: "This discovery shall shake the whole Europe"

 ab_punic.10.t: "Gold Found in the New World"
 ab_punic.10.d: "News has reached us of an astonishing discovery in the New World - a vast deposit of gold beyond anything previously imagined. Reports speak of shimmering veins running deep within the unexplored territories, promising wealth on an unprecedented scale. Urgent measures are needed to secure our claim swiftly, before word of this incredible bounty reaches the ears of rival nations. The race is on to establish our presence and exploit this newfound source of riches, which could reshape the balance of power in the world."
 ab_punic.10.a: "We must take action now!"

 ab_punic.11.t: "The Race for Gold"
 ab_punic.11.d: "Word has spread like wildfire of an extraordinary discovery in the New World - a staggering deposit of gold of unparalleled magnitude. However, [From.GetName] has seized upon this knowledge and made decisive moves ahead of us. We must not be left behind in this fervent race for control over the riches that await. Swift action is imperative to assert our claim and ensure that we too are contenders in this high-stakes pursuit of wealth and power."
 ab_punic.11.a: "[From.GetName] will not take it from us!"
 ab_punic.11.b: "We do not have capabilities to compete. Let's just explore other areas"

 ab_punic.13.t: "Palemen Settlement"
 ab_punic.13.d: "Adventurous settlers of the Palemen have established a foothold on our shores at [europeanFirstColony.GetName], bringing with them a wealth of exotic goods and unfamiliar wonders. Their presence introduces new opportunities for trade and cultural exchange, as we marvel at their strange wares and customs. Perhaps we can engage in fruitful exchanges, offering our own unique treasures in return for these novel imports, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship with these new arrivals."
 ab_punic.13.a: "They would make a good trading partner"

 ab_punic.15.t: "The Palemen Threat"
 ab_punic.15.d: "The relentless expansion of the Palemen has increasingly troubled us. Initially, their arrival promised mutual benefits through trade and cooperation. However, as time passed, their demeanor shifted from friendly partners to aggressive conquerors. They have begun to seize more land, encroaching deeper into our territories without our consent. It is only a matter of time before they reveal their true intentions fully, aiming to dominate and control the continent we have inhabited for centuries.\n\nFaced with their superior technology and advanced military, challenging the Palemen head-on would be tantamount to suicide. We find ourselves at a crossroads: to continue on our current path would mean inevitable subjugation, but to fight back in our current state would be futile. Thus, we must adapt and evolve, turning their own advancements against them. By studying and adopting the technologies of our enemies, we can enhance our society, advancing our civilization to a level where we can resist their incursions.\n\nIt is a daunting task, but necessity dictates that we rise to the challenge. We must learn from our adversaries, harness their innovations, and transform our society to stand as equals on the world stage. Only then can we hope to protect our homeland and preserve our way of life against the Palemen threat."
 ab_punic.15.a: "Preparations must be done for the worst"

 ab_punic.17.t: "Conquest of Paradise"
 ab_punic.17.d: "The adventurous spirit of Andalusia has driven them to the New World, where they have begun to spread their faith of Islam across these distant lands. This alarming development has not gone unnoticed, and the Pope has issued a fervent call to arms - a Western Crusade. Every devout Catholic is urged to embark on this holy mission, to venture westward and reclaim these lands for Christianity. The faithful are called to push back the influence of the Saracens, to plant the cross where the crescent now rises, and to ensure that the new paradise discovered across the ocean remains a stronghold of our Christian faith. This is a divine mandate, a sacred duty, and an opportunity to expand Christendom to the furthest reaches of the world."
 ab_punic.17.a: "Praise the Lord"

 ab_punic.20.t: "An Assassination Attempt in [assassinationTarget.GetName]"
 ab_punic.20.d: "Our agents have successfully infiltrated the court of our political rival, positioning themselves close to the heart of power. With everything in place, we now have the opportunity to strike decisively, weakening our adversary once and for all."

 ab_punic.25.t: "Our Accomplice Has Been Caught"
 ab_punic.25.d: "Our accomplices succeeded in eliminating the target, but their success was short-lived. They have been captured, and under interrogation, our involvement has been exposed."

 ab_punic.28.t: "Failed Attempt"

 ab_punic.30.a: "Ok"

 ab_punic.31.t: "Fall of the Punic League"
 ab_punic.31.d: "The Punic League, once a powerful alliance of city-states, has crumbled under the weight of time. What was once a bastion of unity and strength now lies in ruins, its cities collapsed and its influence shattered. Our relentless campaign has brought an end to their centuries-long dominion, leaving us as the undisputed power in the continent. The fall of the League marks the beginning of a new era, one where our dominance is unchallenged."
 ab_punic.31.a: "The Punics should have stayed dead in the Antiquity"

 ab_punic.32.t: "Revive the Legacy of Hannibal"
 ab_punic.32.d: "Hannibal once led our ancestors across the vast ocean to the shores of Buniq, seeking refuge from the relentless pursuit of Rome. For over a thousand years, we have flourished in this new land, forging a powerful Punic League that now stands united under a single banner. But the memory of our ancestral homeland has never faded, and the time has come to reclaim what was taken from us.\n\nAs European colonizers encroach upon our lands, bringing war and diseases, we must respond not only by defending Buniq but by carrying the fight back to their home. Just as Hannibal once crossed the Alps to challenge Rome itself, we will cross the seas, but this time, not as exiles, but as conquerors. The Old World awaits our return, and with it, the restoration of Carthage to its rightful place as the master of the Mediterranean. We shall reclaim the lands of our forefathers, overthrow our enemies, and bring the full might of Carthage to bear upon those who dared to invade our new world. The legacy of Hannibal will be fulfilled, and the Punic people shall rise again, victorious in both worlds."

 ab_punic.35.d2: "We have stopped receiving resources from the Easima for our expansion."
 ab_punic.35.a: "Ok"

 ab_punic.37.t: "Spread of Authoritarianism"
 ab_punic.37.d: "In the bustling city of Hannibal, the heart of the Punic League, whispers of a new ideology have taken root. These ideas, carried from the distant Cahokian Empire, challenge the very foundations of our democratic principles. They speak of concentrated power, of a single ruler guiding the state with a firm hand, a stark contrast to the League's tradition of shared governance.\n\nYet, not all view these notions with disdain. Among the oligarchs, there is a growing fascination, a desire to reshape the League's power structure in their favor. They see in these ideas a path to greater control, a means to refine their influence and secure their authority. As these thoughts spread through the corridors of power, the seeds of authoritarianism begin to take hold, threatening to reshape the very fabric of our society."
 ab_punic.37.a: "Time of changes is coming..."

 ab_punic.38.t: "Imperial Academy"
 ab_punic.38.d: "The Punic League has always valued the pursuit of knowledge, but the time has come to formalize and elevate our scholarly endeavors. In the city of Hadrumetum, renowned for its wisdom and intellectual prowess, the Imperial Academy has been founded. This grand institution, unparalleled in Buniq, will cultivate the brightest minds of the League, preparing them for leadership, diplomacy, and warfare alike.\n\nThe Academy offers three distinct schools, each dedicated to a critical aspect of governance. The School of Administration fosters statesmen and bureaucrats, perfecting the art of governance. The School of Diplomacy shapes diplomats and orators, skilled in negotiation and foreign affairs. Meanwhile, the School of Warfare molds tacticians and generals, ensuring our armies remain unmatched in strategic mastery. This institution will serve as a beacon of enlightenment and power for the Punic League, guiding us into a prosperous future."
 ab_punic.38.a: "Let's invest in the School of Administration"
 ab_punic.38.b: "Let's invest in the School of Diplomacy"
 ab_punic.38.c: "Let's invest in the School of Warfare"

 ab_punic.39.t: "Discovery of the Old World"
 ab_punic.39.d: "On our daring voyage eastward, across the vast and treacherous seas, we have made an astounding discovery - the Old World, the fabled lands from which our ancestors once hailed. These distant shores are no longer inhabited by scattered tribes or forgotten peoples, but by powerful, advanced civilizations, whose wealth, culture, and knowledge far surpass our own. Their cities gleam with towering structures, their armies march in disciplined ranks, and their mastery of technology and commerce is unlike anything we have ever seen.\n\nThe discovery of these mighty realms presents us with a monumental decision: Should we seek to learn from these great nations, forging alliances and adopting their ways in hopes of elevating our own civilization? Or should we view their advancements with suspicion and prepare to face them as rivals, lest they see our growing strength as a threat? The course we choose now will shape our future on the world stage as we stand at the threshold of rediscovering our forgotten origins."
 ab_punic.39.a: "Embrace their wisdom and learn from them"
 ab_punic.39.b: "View them as rivals and prepare for conflict"

 ab_punic.40.t: "New Gods"
 ab_punic.40.d: "In recent years, strange new beliefs have washed upon our shores, carried by the missionaries of the Palemen from across the sea. These foreign religions, with their unfamiliar gods and practices, have begun to take root in the corners of our society. Their priests preach of salvation and righteousness, while their followers grow in number, forming small but growing communities within our cities. The old ways of our ancestors, once unchallenged, now face the looming presence of these new faiths.\n\nAs the influence of these foreign gods spreads, we stand at a crossroads. The Canaanite traditions that have bound us together for centuries are being tested by these new ideas. Should we zealously reject these foreign intrusions and strengthen our devotion to Baal Hammon and Tanit? Should we cautiously accept the presence of these communities, allowing them to coexist alongside our faith, but with restrictions? Or, perhaps, should we embrace these new gods fully, abandoning the ancient rites in favor of conversion? The decision we make will ripple through the Punic League and forever alter our spiritual identity."
 ab_punic.40.a: "Reject the foreign gods and reaffirm our devotion to the Canaanite deities"
 ab_punic.40.b: "Allow the new faiths to coexist, but maintain our traditions"
 ab_punic.40.c: "Convert to the new faith and embrace a new spiritual path"

 ab_punic.41.t: "Smuggling Goods"
 ab_punic.41.d: "The Muskogean Crime Syndicate controls access to a wealth of rare and exotic goods, found only in the dark alleys of the Black Market. Their connections span across distant lands and secretive trade routes, offering commodities that cannot be obtained through legitimate channels. As demand rises within our cities, the allure of these forbidden goods becomes impossible to ignore. Now, through the right channels, we can smuggle in one such treasure to satisfy our people's desires. Coffee, with its energizing aroma; incense, sacred and revered; sugar, a symbol of luxury; spices, rich with foreign taste; or cocoa, the rarest of indulgences. Which will we choose to enhance our market and fortunes?"
 ab_punic.41.a: "Coffee"
 ab_punic.41.b: "Incense"
 ab_punic.41.c: "Sugar"
 ab_punic.41.e: "Spices"
 ab_punic.41.f: "Cocoa"

 ab_punic.42.t: "The Fourth Aldiraq"
 ab_punic.42.d: "The Easima of the Punic League has extended a rare and prestigious offer: to join their League as the Fourth Aldiraq. This honor would elevate our people to a status shared only by a select few, granting us access to the vast knowledge, technologies, and wealth that have allowed the Punics to flourish. Their ways are foreign, but their mastery of trade and governance could open new doors for our tribe. By accepting, we stand to gain prosperity beyond what we have ever known, yet we must weigh the cost of aligning ourselves so closely with their ambitions."
 ab_punic.42.a: "Accept the offer"
 ab_punic.42.b: "Never!"

 ab_punic.43.t: "The Fourth Aldiraq"
 ab_punic.43.d: "[From.GetName] has accepted our offer. They have become a new member of the League."
 ab_punic.43.a: "Great!"

 ab_punic.44.t: "The Fourth Aldiraq"
 ab_punic.44.d: "[From.GetName] has denied our offer. They prefer staying independent from the League."
 ab_punic.44.a: "Oh well..."

 ab_punic.46.t: "Return to Aphriqa"
 ab_punic.46.d: "The long-held dream of reclaiming Qart-Hadast, the ancient heart of our people, has finally been realized. After centuries in exile, we stand before the ruins of our ancestral home in Aphriqa. The air is thick with history and the weight of decisions to come. Some argue that Buniq is now our true homeland, a land of untold wealth and opportunity. Others call for a triumphant return to Aphriqa, to rebuild the capital that once stood as the jewel of the Mediterranean. The future of Carthage hangs in the balance - shall we stay in Buniq, or return to our roots in Qart-Hadast?"
 ab_punic.46.a: "Return to Qart-Hadast"
 ab_punic.46.b: "Remain in Buniq"

 ab_punic.47.t: "Sack of [118.GetName]"
 ab_punic.47.d: "The great city of Roma, once the heart of an empire that brought about the destruction of our ancestors, now lies at our mercy. With the Punic banners flying over its walls, we stand on the brink of revenge that has been centuries in the making. The memories of Qart-Hadast, burned to ashes by the Romans, call for retribution. Yet, there are those who believe that to burn Roma would be to repeat the mistakes of the past. Instead, we could spare the city, showing the world that Carthage has risen above such acts of vengeance, as a beacon of civilization and benevolence."
 ab_punic.47.a: "Burn it to the ground!"
 ab_punic.47.b: "Spare the city. We are not the same monster like them"

 ab_punic.1002.t: "The Pale Death"
 ab_punic.1002.d1: "A strange and deadly disease has begun to spread among the native population of this new continent. While it poses little threat to us Europeans, it has proven to be devastating to the locals, who have no immunity against such afflictions. They have named this scourge 'The Pale Death', a grim reference to its origins. The natives have been calling us 'Palemen' because of our light skin, and now, the disease we inadvertently brought with us bears that same ominous moniker.\n\nThe symptoms are terrifying: swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, and blackened skin, reminiscent of the bubonic plague that once ravaged our own lands. Despite our initial efforts to detect and contain the outbreak, we have been unsuccessful. It is now spreading like wildfire, unchecked and relentless, across this vast continent. Villages are decimated, and the native population is succumbing in alarming numbers.\n\nOur presence here, once seen as a harbinger of opportunity and exchange, has turned into a nightmare for the indigenous peoples. The impact of this epidemic is catastrophic, threatening to wipe out entire communities and cultures. As we witness the unfolding tragedy, we must confront the harsh reality of our unintended role in this devastating epidemic. The future remains uncertain as the disease continues its relentless march, leaving despair and death in its wake."
 ab_punic.1002.d2: "A year has passed since the emergence of the strange disease among our people, now known as 'The Pale Death'. We have learned with sorrow and anger that this affliction was brought to our lands by the Palemen. This devastating plague, originating from beyond the great waters, has inflicted catastrophic damage upon our continent.\n\nThe once-promise of new encounters and exchanges with the Palemen has turned into a nightmare of loss and mourning. The effects of 'The Pale Death' are harrowing: swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, and the haunting blackened skin that marks its victims. Entire villages have been decimated, and many of our people have perished.\n\nWe mourn our losses and struggle to comprehend the enormity of this tragedy. Our shamans and elders speak of spirits angered by this invasion, and our healers labor tirelessly to ease the suffering of those afflicted.\n\nAs we gather our strength and resilience, we vow to protect our lands and our way of life from further devastation. The scars of 'The Pale Death' run deep, but we remain steadfast in our resolve to endure and rebuild, guided by the wisdom of our ancestors and the spirits of Buniq."

The disease, which claimed countless lives and left scars upon our communities, has now dwindled in its ferocity.\n\nAs we begin to rebuild our villages and heal our wounded spirits, we remember those who were lost to 'The Pale Death' and honor their memory. This chapter in our history serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the resilience of our people. Though the land still bears the scars of our encounter with the Palemen, we look forward with hope and determination to a future where our great Buniq can thrive once more."

The once-distant threat is now a stark reality, threatening to devastate our nation.

 ab_punic.1006.a: "We must contain the affected areas!"

 ab_punic.1009.t: "The Gray Fever"
 ab_punic.1009.d: "In the bustling ports of Europe, a new and deadly scourge has emerged, carried back from the distant shores of the Americas by our own explorers and colonizers. This plague, known as 'The Gray Fever', has struck with unrelenting ferocity. The name, whispered with dread, derives from the ashen pallor that overtakes the skin of those afflicted.\n\nThe patients are strucked with high fever, severe fatigue, aching muscles, and a relentless, suffocating cough. Our people, unprepared and lacking any immunity to this foreign malady, are succumbing in ever-increasing numbers. The initial outbreak, unnoticed and unchecked, has now spread like wildfire across the continent, overwhelming our cities and towns.\n\nHospitals overflow with the sick and dying, while fear and uncertainty grip the hearts of the populace. Our efforts to contain this unseen enemy have proven futile, and the toll mounts daily. The epidemic advances inexorably, leaving a trail of despair and death in its wake. In this darkest hour, we must rally our strength and seek every means to combat and overcome this devastating plague."

 ab_punic.1012.d: "After years of relentless suffering and loss, the plague that once ravaged our lands has finally begun to wane. The dreadful disease, which decimated our population and left deep scars on our communities, has gradually lost its grip. There is a sense of cautious relief as the last of the afflicted begin to recover and new cases become rare.\n\nOur healers and physicians, who have labored tirelessly against this relentless foe, can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The resilience and unity of our people have seen us through the darkest of times. The once-overwhelmed hospitals and makeshift infirmaries are beginning to empty, and the mournful toll of funeral bells has slowed."

 ab_punic.1013.d: "The dreaded plague, which we have come to know through harrowing reports and grim tales, has finally breached our borders. Despite our best efforts to keep this scourge at bay, it has found its way into [Root.GetName]. Panic and despair grip our people as the disease spreads relentlessly through our towns and villages.\n\nOur healers and physicians, though aware of the epidemic's nature, are overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the outbreak. The familiar symptoms bring dread, as families are torn apart and communities are brought to their knees. We had hoped to avoid this fate, but now we must confront the brutal reality of the plague within our lands."
 ab_punic.1013.a: "We must contain the affected areas!"

 ab_punic.1014.t: "Depleted Manpower"
 ab_punic.1014.d: "The plague has ravaged our armies, leaving countless soldiers too ill to fight and many dead. Our once formidable forces are now severely weakened, posing a grave threat to our defense and security."
 ab_punic.1014.a: "Cursed"

 ab_punic.1015.t: "Miracle Cure Rumors"
 ab_punic.1015.d: "Rumors of a miraculous cure for the plague have begun to circulate in [diseaseProv.GetName]. Desperate for hope, people flock to healers and charlatans alike, seeking relief. Authorities must decide whether to investigate these claims or dismiss them as false hope."

Its fire temples, once a testament to the divine truth of Ahura Mazda, are extinguished, their sanctuaries desecrated by foreign hands. The walls that safeguarded this sacred ground have crumbled under relentless siege, and the cries of its defenders are now silenced by the triumphant shouts of the conquerors.\n\nThis city was not just a fortress but the heart of the Zoroastrian world in Buniq - a symbol of righteousness, unity, and divine order. Its fall is more than a military loss; it is a spiritual wound, a desecration of the very ideals it represented. Yet, even in the face of such tragedy, the faithful may find solace in the teachings of their prophet: that light can emerge even from the deepest darkness."

According to legend, these radiant plants not only cured his mortal affliction but granted him vigor that defied the march of time, enabling him to lead our people to greatness.\n\nNow, with the region of Itthobaal firmly under our control, we face a momentous decision. The golden herbs, if harvested carefully, could enhance the well-being of our citizens, transforming their lives and enriching our society. Yet, their value as a rare and coveted resource offers another path: selling them to foreign traders for immense profit, bolstering our coffers and strengthening our economy."

The temples of Athens, the halls of Sparta, and the marketplaces of Thebes - all stand ready to be restored to their former glory. Yet, with this triumph comes a question that will shape the future of these storied lands.\n\nShould we directly govern Hellas, bringing it under the enlightened guidance of the Hylinian culture, ensuring its prosperity as an integral part of our realm? Or should we release a proxy state, a new Hellenic Empire, to serve as a vanguard of our influence and as the shining beacon of Hellenism reborn?"

The speed with which we have claimed territory, established strongholds, and fostered prosperity has unsettled the established powers. Seeing our rise as a direct threat to their own sovereignty and influence, the nations of Buniq are beginning to unite against us. Former rivals are setting aside their differences, forging alliances to form a bulwark against our expansion. The balance of power is shifting, and the continent teeters on the brink of a new era. The path we choose now, and how we handle this burgeoning coalition, will shape the destiny of our nation and the future of Buniq."
 ab_punic.67.a: "Let them come, we will crush them all!"

 ab_punic.68.t: "Threat of [From.GetName]"
 ab_punic.68.d: "The drums of war echo across Buniq as news spreads of [From.GetName]'s relentless conquests. Once a peaceful part of the continent, they have broken free and now march with the zeal of expansionist ambition. Cities have fallen, territories have been seized, and the stability of the continent hangs in the balance.\n\nIf left unchallenged, their influence will dominate all of Buniq, and their shadow will darken the futures of all free nations. Now, our survival demands unity. Allies must be sought, old grudges must be forgotten, and preparations for war must begin. The fate of Buniq depends on the strength of those who dare to resist the rising titan."
 ab_punic.68.a: "We must stop their ambitious goal"

 ab_punic.70.t: "Hasrudart Pass"
 ab_punic.70.d: "Nestled within the mighty Allegheny Mountains lies the Hasrudart Pass, a gateway to boundless opportunity and a wellspring of untold riches. This narrow but strategic corridor cuts through the heart of the wilderness, leading to vast, unclaimed forests ripe with potential. It is here that the elusive Silk Road Federation has made its hidden abode, weaving a network of trade that threads through the shadows of the woods like the silken strands of their craft.\n\nOur emissaries report that cooperation with these masterful weavers could spark an age of prosperity for our nation, with silk production bringing wealth and prestige to our realm. Yet the allure of Hasrudart Pass extends beyond mere commerce. Deep in this wooded sanctuary lies a chance to create a fortress of faith and governance, protected by nature's bastion. Should we move our capital to this hallowed ground, it could signify a bold new chapter for the Cherokee Order, blending the divine light of Ahura Mazda with the unyielding strength of the wilderness."
 ab_punic.70.a: "The woods would protect our rulers"
 ab_punic.70.b: "We prefer our current seat of power"

 ab_punic.71.t: "Observing the Sky"
 ab_punic.71.d: "The Sky Dome, now elevated to its fullest grandeur, stands as a beacon of knowledge and faith in the heart of our nation. Beneath its celestial canopy, the Magi and scholars gather, their eyes fixed on the heavens in search of divine truths hidden among the stars. They chart constellations, interpret omens, and debate the cosmic forces that shape the world.\n\nDuring the latest celestial observation, the Magi have made remarkable discoveries. They believe the alignment of the stars reveals profound insights that could guide us in our governance, inspire our faith, or strengthen our warriors."
 ab_punic.71.a: "The stars guide the righteous"
 ab_punic.71.b: "Heaven's wisdom guides the state"
 ab_punic.71.c: "The stars favor the blade"

 ab_punic.73.t: "Raze of [917.GetName]"
 ab_punic.73.d: "The walls of [917.GetName] have fallen, and its defenders scattered before the might of our armies. Once a bastion of Jewish religion over Buniq, the city's greatest symbol of piety, its grand temple, now stands vulnerable. The decision is swift and unyielding - our forces set about dismantling the structure, brick by brick, leaving no trace of its former glory. Smoke and ash rise into the skies as the sacred halls are consumed by flames. The streets are filled with the cries of those who once revered this site, now witnessing its utter destruction. The raze of [917.GetName] will serve as a grim message to all who dare defy us."
 ab_punic.73.a: "Let the fire purify"

 ab_punic.74.t: "Raze of [917.GetName]"
 ab_punic.74.d: "A calamity has struck the heart of our faith. News spreads like wildfire across the lands: the grand temple of [917.GetName], a cornerstone of our devotion and a beacon of Jewish culture, has been razed by foreign invaders.\n\nThe sacred halls, where countless prayers echoed and traditions were upheld, are now nothing but smoldering ruins. The city of [917.GetName], once a symbol of resilience and faith, stands desecrated, its people scattered and its spirit wounded. This affront is not merely an attack on a city but a blow to all who hold true to the covenant.\n\nLet the nations of the faithful take heed: such barbarity cannot go unanswered. The defenders of our faith must rise to ensure that such tragedy never befalls us again."
 ab_punic.74.a: "Who is gonna save us now?"

 ab_punic.75.t: "Request from the Order"
 ab_punic.75.d: "Word has reached our court of an envoy dispatched by [From.GetName], carrying with them the teachings of Zoroaster and the weight of their nation's growing supremacy over Buniq. These priests, adorned in ceremonial robes and speaking of light and truth, seek to guide our people toward the faith of Ahura Mazda.\n\nThey bring not just words but promises: alliances strengthened, trade routes safeguarded, and the wisdom of an ancient faith to guide us through the trials of this world. Yet, the request is not without its challenges. To embrace their beliefs would require us to abandon the traditions that have shaped our identity."
 ab_punic.75.a: "Accept the light of Ahura Mazda"
 ab_punic.75.b: "We respect their faith but shall remain steadfast"

 ab_punic.76.t: "Request from the Order"
 ab_punic.76.d1: "The priests we sent to [From.GetName] have returned with joyous tidings. The rulers of [From.GetName], after much deliberation, have embraced the faith of Ahura Mazda and pledged themselves to the path of righteousness. Their lands now resonate with the hymns of the Gathas, and their people have begun their journey toward the truth."
 ab_punic.76.d2: "The messengers we dispatched to [From.GetName] have returned bearing troubling news. Despite our envoys' efforts and the wisdom of the teachings they carried, the rulers of [From.GetName] have refused to embrace the faith of Ahura Mazda."
 ab_punic.76.a: "Okay"

 ab_punic.77.t: "Aldiraq Uprising"
 ab_punic.77.d: "The unification of the Punic League into the centralized authority of Carthage has stirred unrest among the Aldiraqs. For centuries, these tribal chieftains enjoyed autonomy under the loose hegemony of the League, maintaining their traditions and self-governance.\n\nNow, the centralization of power threatens to strip them of their ancient rights and privileges. Fearing subjugation and loss of identity, the Aldiraqs have cast aside their differences and banded together in open defiance. Their banners rise high, and their war cries echo through the land, signaling their intent to resist Carthage's authority."
 ab_punic.77.a: "Insolent! They shall pay for this"

 ab_punic.78.t: "City of Gold"
 ab_punic.78.d: "The founding of the Bazaar of Kanmi marks a turning point in our history. Situated on the main route to the Muskogean Crime Syndicate, this bustling hub has rapidly become a center of wealth and trade, earning its name as the 'City of Gold'. Merchants from all corners of Buniq bring their wares to its thriving markets, while its strategic position allows us to siphon profits from the Syndicate's illicit activities.\n\nNow, a bold question arises: should Kanmi, with its golden roads and vibrant economy, become the new heart of Kataqart? Shifting our capital to this jewel of commerce could symbolize a new era of prosperity and ambition for our nation, but such a decision would reshape the course of our destiny."
 ab_punic.78.a: "Kanmi shall be the capital of Kataqart"
 ab_punic.78.b: "Our heart remains where it is needed most"

 ab_punic.79.t: "Art of Defense"
 ab_punic.79.d: "Jewish warfare has long been guided by principles of resilience and strategic brilliance, emphasizing the importance of defense as the foundation of survival and prosperity. From the fortifications of ancient Judea to the steadfastness of the Covenant warriors, our traditions teach us that a well-defended realm is the bastion of faith and freedom. Now, scholars and generals gather to debate the future of our military doctrines. Shall we fortify our cities, train elite defenders, or invest in innovative defensive strategies to protect our people and lands?"
 ab_punic.79.a: "Fortify our strongholds"
 ab_punic.79.b: "Train the guards"
 ab_punic.79.c: "Innovate defensive tactics"

 ab_punic.80.t: "Fall of Christianity"
 ab_punic.80.d: "The unthinkable has come to pass: the sacred bastions of Christendom, Rome and Constantinople, have fallen to the forces of the Torah. These two cities, once the twin pillars of the Christian faith and the beating hearts of the Bible's dominion, now lie in the hands of a new and ascendant order. The cross has been toppled from its throne, and the sound of the shofar echoes where once church bells rang. This catastrophe has not only shattered the earthly strongholds of Christianity but has left its faithful adrift, their unity and divine mission in question.\n\nFrom the ashes of this upheaval rises a profound challenge. The triumphant bearers of the Torah have extended an offer, one that sends tremors through the hearts of the faithful: convert to Judaism and embrace the covenant of the Law, or refuse and risk becoming relics of a fading faith. With the dominance of the Torah now unchallenged, the Bible's words are eclipsed by the Laws of Moses, leaving no sanctuary for those unwilling to bend.\n\nAs the remnants of Christendom face this choice, the very soul of the Christian world hangs in the balance. Will we submit to this new Abrahamic order, or will we stand defiant, knowing the cost of resistance? The future of our faith, and of those who hold it dear, is now at stake."
 ab_punic.80.a: "We have no choice..."
 ab_punic.80.b: "No! We will stay Christian until our very end"

 ab_punic.81.t: "Zion Reclaimed"
 ab_punic.81.d: "Zion has been reclaimed, and the Holy Land, promised to our forebears by the Almighty, is once again under the protection of the faithful. The streets of Jerusalem, ancient and sacred, resonate with the prayers of those who have endured centuries of exile and longing. The revival of Hebrew, the tongue of prophets and kings, heralds a new age of unity and purpose for our people.\n\nPilgrims flock to the rebuilt temple, their voices lifted in hymns of gratitude, as the covenant with our Creator is renewed in the land where it was first forged. The orchards of Judea bloom once more, and the waters of the Jordan flow with the blessings of divine providence. Zion, no longer a distant dream, stands as a beacon of hope and strength for our faith.\n\nYet, with this triumph comes great responsibility. The eyes of the world are upon us, some in awe, others in envy. The sacred task of preserving this sanctuary, ensuring its prosperity, and defending it against those who would see it fall again, now lies with us. Zion is not merely reclaimed; it is reborn, and with it, the spirit of our people rises anew."
 ab_punic.81.a: "God answered our prayers!"

 ab_punic.83.t: "Fall of Islam"
 ab_punic.83.d: "The Kaaba, the heart of Islam and the axis of the faithful's prayers, has fallen into the hands of those who uphold the Torah above all. The once-revered house of worship now stands under the shadow of the dominant Jewish faith, its black stone a silent witness to the unyielding tide of change sweeping across the world.\n\nThe ulama whisper in dismay, the verses of the Quran challenged by the triumph of Mosaic law. Across the lands of Dar al-Islam, the faithful face a stark choice: to persist in the path of the Prophet, knowing that their dominion has crumbled, or to embrace the Torah and join the covenant of Abraham in its purest form.\n\nThis is no ordinary defeat - it is the dawn of a new spiritual order, where Judaism stands as the supreme Abrahamic faith. To those who resist, this marks the end of an era, an age where Islam commanded empires and inspired millions. To those who submit, it is a chance to survive and flourish under the new covenant.\n\nWill we succumb, holding onto the fragments of our broken legacy, or will we choose to convert, seeking refuge and renewal under the Torah's triumph?"
 ab_punic.83.a: "We have no choice..."
 ab_punic.83.b: "No! We will stay Muslim until our very end"

 ab_punic.85.t: "[GetYear] Tournament of Ahnar"
 ab_punic.85.d: "Every five years, the grand Tournament of Ahnar unites the Aldiraqs, the unyielding swords of the Punic League, in a spectacle of valor and strategy. From all corners of the League, the finest infantry, cavalry, and archers gather to engage in fierce combat, each Aldiraq choosing their champions to represent their strength. The tournament unfolds in pivotal matches, where the disciplines of war collide in a contest of wits and skill, determining a victor by the ancient rule of arms.\n\nEumdas from Punic cities, eager to test their fortunes, place wagers on their favored champions. Victory brings not only honor to the winning Aldiraq but also rewards to the supporters whose faith proves true. The Easima presides over this legendary gathering, fostering unity and celebrating the martial spirit that binds the League together."

 ab_punic.86.t: "[GetYear] Tournament of Ahnar"
 ab_punic.86.d: "The grand Tournament of Ahnar has begun, a glorious display of Aldiraq strength and strategy. Each Aldiraq has chosen their finest warriors to compete in this honor-bound contest, where infantry, cavalry, and archers vie for supremacy. The Easima calls upon the Eumdas of the Punic cities to join the festivities and place their wager on the Aldiraq they believe will emerge triumphant.\n\nWill your chosen Aldiraq rise to glory, securing both honor and reward for your foresight?

 ab_punic.87.d: "The Tournament of Ahnar stands as a testament to the martial might of the Aldiraqs, a celebration of valor and strategy that defines the very essence of their role within the Punic League. Every five years, the Easima summons the Aldiraqs to send forth their finest - infantry, cavalry, or archers - to compete in this grand contest of arms. Each match, determined by wit and prowess, honors the rock-paper-scissors balance of warfare: infantry counters archers, archers outmaneuver cavalry, and cavalry crushes infantry.\n\nBeyond mere sport, the tournament reinforces the bond between the Punic League and its vassals. The Eumdas of the Punic cities place their wagers, their allegiances tested, as they cheer for their chosen Aldiraq. Glory, prestige, and tangible rewards await both the victor and their supporters.\n\nNow, as the Eumdas finalize their bets, the anticipation crescendos. Soon, the arena will thunder with the clash of steel and the roar of spectators. Let the Tournament of Ahnar commence!"
 ab_punic.87.a: "The warriors of [Root.GetName] shall proclaim victory!"

 ab_punic.89.t: "Tournament Disrupted"
 ab_punic.89.d: "The harmonious spectacle of the Tournament of Ahnar has been shattered by dire news. As the Aldiraqs clashed in honorable combat to demonstrate their strength and unity, one of their own has been struck down - not by sword or arrow in the arena, but by annexation beyond its borders.\n\nThis act of aggression against the Aldiraqs has thrown the League into chaos, its delicate balance of power threatened. The Easima, caught between the mantle of leadership and the demands of war, must act swiftly to restore order.\n\nThe Tournament is suspended, its outcome left incomplete, as the Punic League turns its focus to this grave affront."
 ab_punic.89.a: "A tragedy for the League"

 ab_punic.90.t: "Choose Our Warriors"
 ab_punic.90.d1: "The time has come for us to face against [aldiraqTeamB.GetName]. We must decide the composition of our forces.\n\nWill we rely on the unyielding discipline of infantry to hold the line and crush the enemy with steadfast might? Or will we trust in the precision and agility of our archers, whose volleys can pierce through even the toughest of formations? Perhaps the thundering charge of cavalry, swift and overwhelming, shall be our weapon of choice."
 ab_punic.90.d2: "The time has come for us to face against [aldiraqTeamA.GetName]. We must decide the composition of our forces.\n\nWill we rely on the unyielding discipline of infantry to hold the line and crush the enemy with steadfast might? Or will we trust in the precision and agility of our archers, whose volleys can pierce through even the toughest of formations? Perhaps the thundering charge of cavalry, swift and overwhelming, shall be our weapon of choice."

Let the celebration commence, for our triumph will be remembered in the annals of the League!"
 ab_punic.95.a: "Cheers"

 ab_punic.96.t: "Defeat in Ahnar"
 ab_punic.96.d: "Defeat stings deeply. Despite the valor of our warriors and the strength of our resolve, [From.GetName] has claimed the crown of the Tournament of Ahnar. The cheers for their victory ring hollow in our ears, and the glory we sought slips from our grasp for now.\n\nBut we are not broken. In this defeat, we find the ember of determination. Our warriors will return stronger, our strategies more cunning, and the lessons of this tournament will guide us to triumph. The others may celebrate today, but they underestimate the fire of our ambition.\n\nWhen the next Tournament of Ahnar arrives, we shall march forward with renewed strength.

If fortune smiled upon our chosen champion, the prestige of our foresight is celebrated throughout the League. Yet, if our chosen Aldiraq faltered, we must bear the sting of loss and accept that even the shrewdest of bets can be undone by the chaos of war.\n\nThe Tournament is over, but its stories will linger, and the rivalry it fosters will shape the League for years to come."

 ab_punic.118.d: "Conflict brews on the high seas as Punic and Hylinian merchants clash over control of lucrative trade routes.

 punic_rise_of_carthage: "Rise of Carthage"
 ab_punic.132.t: "Rise of Carthage"
 ab_punic.132.d: "The formation of Carthage has sent shockwaves across the continent of Buniq. No longer a collection of allied city-states, we now stand as a singular, centralized power: a beacon of Punic strength and ambition. Yet, this newfound unity has not gone unnoticed.\n\nThe other powers of Buniq whisper of Carthage's growing might, viewing our rise as a disruption to the delicate balance of power. Fear and envy ripple through their courts and councils. Rumors abound of alliances forged in secret, of coalitions taking shape to curb our ambitions and dismantle the strength we have so carefully built."
 ab_punic.132.a: "Carthage must prepare"

 ab_punic.134.t: "Rise of Carthage"
 ab_punic.134.d: "Word reaches the Senate of Rome: the Punic League has centralized under a single banner, restoring the ancient power of a Carthage. The Easima has declared their city the successor to the ancient Punic homeland, uniting the disparate Punic cities of Buniq. Reports tell of a disciplined navy, fortified trade routes, and ambitions to rival even the might of Rome itself.\n\nThe echoes of the Punic Wars stir once more, and with them, the question arises: will Rome rise to meet this new Carthaginian threat, or allow history to repeat itself?"
 ab_punic.134.a: "Prepare for war. The Punics will not rise again"

 ab_punic.135.t: "Question of Punic Cities"
 ab_punic.135.d: "The Punic cities, once bound together by mutual benefit within the League, now find themselves grappling with the realities of centralized rule. As Carthage asserts its dominance, whispers of discontent echo through the streets of Tanit, Utica, and beyond. Some cities demand greater representation in the new government, fearing their voices will be drowned out by the growing strength of Carthage. Others lament the loss of their cherished autonomy, viewing Carthage's rise as a betrayal of the League's founding principles."
 ab_punic.135.a: "Offer greater representation to placate the cities"
 ab_punic.135.b: "Reaffirm our authority and suppress dissent"

 ab_punic.136.t: "Anti-Centralization Movement"
 ab_punic.136.d: "The old noble families, guardians of tradition and wielders of ancient privileges, have taken a stand against the tide of centralization. To them, the rise of Carthage represents not progress, but a betrayal of the decentralized principles that once defined the Punic League. In their eyes, the Easima's authority is overreaching, threatening their ancestral rights and the autonomy of their cities.\n\nUnwilling to yield, they have raised their banners in defiance, rallying supporters who share their disdain for Carthage's new order. The flames of rebellion flicker across the League. We must act decisively to quash this uprising, or risk seeing its grand vision undone."
 ab_punic.136.a: "Oh? You dare to challenge me?"

 ab_punic.137.t: "Buniq Coalition"
 ab_punic.137.d: "The rumors have proven true. Fearing the might of Carthage and seizing upon the chaos of our internal struggles, the nations of Buniq have set aside their rivalries to forge a coalition against us. They speak of preserving balance and liberty, but their true motives are rooted in envy and fear of our rise.\n\nThis alliance of wary neighbors and opportunistic foes will not wait long to act. They see in our current instability the perfect moment to strike, seeking to weaken Carthage before it can fully assert its dominance. The drums of war echo across the continent, and the eyes of Buniq turn toward us."
 ab_punic.137.a: "Those cowards!"

 ab_punic.138.t: "War of the Buniq Coalition"
 ab_punic.138.d: "The inevitable has come to pass. The coalition of Buniq, united by their fear and jealousy of our power, has cast aside any pretense of peace and declared war upon us. Their banners rise in unison, a grim testament to their intent to halt Carthage's ascent and dismantle our burgeoning dominion.\n\nTheir armies march not just to conquer but to break the will of Carthage, exploiting our internal divisions and pressing against our borders with relentless determination. They seek to erase the vision of a unified Punic legacy from the annals of history.\n\nNow is the time to stand firm, to rally our forces, and to show them that Carthage will not be broken. This is a battle not just for survival but for the future of the Punic people."
 ab_punic.138.a: "Their combined might cannot best us!"

 ab_punic.139.t: "Alliance Broken"
 ab_punic.139.d: "In our time of greatest need, betrayal cuts deep. The shadow of the Buniq Coalition looms large, and fear has gripped the hearts of those we once called allies. Their promises of support, forged in times of peace and prosperity, have now crumbled under the weight of looming conflict.\n\nCowardice, self-preservation, or perhaps even quiet resentment. Whatever their reasons, they have chosen to abandon us, refusing to stand against the tide of enemies threatening to engulf Carthage. Their absence weakens our position and emboldens the Coalition's resolve."
 ab_punic.139.a: "Fine, we don't need them anyway"

 ab_punic.140.t: "War of the Buniq Coalition"
 ab_punic.140.d: "The Punics have grown too bold, their ambitions too great. With the formation of Carthage, they no longer hide their intent to dominate Buniq, casting aside the fragile balance that has preserved peace. Their unchecked expansion threatens all who value sovereignty and independence.\n\nThe Coalition has made its move, and now they call upon us to join the cause. This is not merely a war against Carthage: it is a fight for the freedom of all Buniq's peoples, a stand against hegemony before it tightens its grip over the continent."
 ab_punic.140.a: "Carthage shall fall!"
 ab_punic.140.b: "We should stay out of this"

 ab_punic.141.t: "Coalition Victory"
 ab_punic.141.d: "The unrelenting forces of the Coalition have prevailed, forcing us to face the bitter reality of defeat. Carthage, once the beacon of Punic strength and unity, now stands humbled before a united Buniq.\n\nOur ambitions of continental supremacy have been shattered, leaving us to rebuild amidst the ashes of this humiliating war. The Coalition's victory is not just a blow to our power, it is a clear message to all that Carthage's dominion over Buniq will not go unchallenged."
 ab_punic.141.a: "Dark days lie ahead..."

 ab_punic.142.t: "Coalition Victory"
 ab_punic.142.d: "Victory is ours! The Buniq Coalition, united in purpose, has crushed the ambitions of Carthage, halting its expansion and preserving the delicate balance of Buniq. What once seemed an unstoppable tide of Punic domination has been broken by our shared resolve.\n\nThis triumph is more than a battlefield success: it is a testament to the strength of unity against oppression. Carthage may yet recover, but they will remember this day, and so will we. The balance of power remains intact, and Buniq is safe... for now. Let this serve as a warning to those who would dream of hegemony."
 ab_punic.142.a: "Peace for Buniq!"

 ab_punic.143.t: "Carthage Endures"
 ab_punic.143.d: "Against all odds, Carthage has weathered the storm. The Coalition sought to break our will and shatter our dreams of greatness, but their efforts have proven futile. For ten long years, we have held firm, standing as a testament to Punic resilience and determination.\n\nThough battered, our unity and strength remain unbroken. Let the nations of Buniq take heed: Carthage endures. This war has forged us into something greater, and the Punic phoenix will rise, more resolute and determined than ever to claim its rightful place in history."
 ab_punic.143.a: "For Hannibal!"

 ab_punic.144.t: "Carthage Endures"
 ab_punic.144.d: "Ten years have passed, and yet Carthage remains, defiant and unyielding. Despite our combined efforts, the Punic state has not crumbled under the weight of the Coalition's might. Their survival is a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nThough we sought to preserve the balance of power in Buniq, Carthage's endurance casts a shadow over our victory. The Punic people have proven their resilience, and the specter of their ambitions lingers still. This is no end but a pause - a reckoning deferred, not avoided."
 ab_punic.144.a: "Peace for Buniq!"

 ab_punic.145.t: "A Fractured Court"
 ab_punic.145.d: "As the war against the Coalition rages on, our court has become a house divided. Factions within our ranks argue fiercely over the future of Carthage. On one side, expansionists urge us to strike hard and seize any opportunity to expand, believing that aggressive action will solidify our power and ensure our survival. On the other, cautious voices call for restraint, warning that further provocation will only invite more enemies to our doorstep and risk plunging the Punic state into irreparable ruin."
 ab_punic.145.a: "Back the warmongers"
 ab_punic.145.b: "We better focus on internal development"

 ab_punic.146.t: "Palemen Intervention"
 ab_punic.146.d: "A dark revelation has surfaced: the Palemen, once neutral in our conflict, are covertly backing the Coalition with both gold and soldiers. Their fear of our rising power has driven them to act against us from the shadows, seeking to undermine our ambitions and stall our growth. This covert support could prolong the war and embolden our enemies, risking further escalation."
 ab_punic.146.a: "Cannot trust those Palemen"

 ab_punic.147.t: "Palemen Intervention"
 ab_punic.147.d: "The Palemen, in their fear of Carthage's expansion, have secretly offered their support to our cause. With gold and soldiers flowing from their coffers, they bolster our efforts against the Punic threat. Their intervention is a calculated move to prevent Carthage from dominating Buniq, and it could provide the momentum we need to secure a decisive victory."
 ab_punic.147.a: "We gladly accept this"

 ab_punic.149.t: "The Coalition Expands"
 ab_punic.149.d: "The ongoing war between Carthage and the Buniq Coalition has caught our attention. A Carthaginian victory would undoubtedly disrupt our future ambitions in the New World, threatening our colonial aspirations. Should Carthage emerge as the dominant force in Buniq, they could pose a formidable obstacle to our influence and expansion. The Buniq Coalition's struggle may offer us an opportunity to intervene, and aligning ourselves with the Coalition side could prove advantageous."
 ab_punic.149.a: "The Coalition needs our strength"
 ab_punic.149.b: "Let's just observe the conflict"

 ab_punic.150.t: "The Coalition Expands"
 ab_punic.150.d: "It seems our struggles on the continent have attracted the eyes of Palemen powers. [From.GetName], wary of our potential dominance over Buniq and its resources, has chosen to support the Coalition against us. Their intervention could shift the balance of the war, increasing the pressure on us as we fight for our survival. We cannot allow them to dictate the fate of Buniq or our expansion in the continent."
 ab_punic.150.a: "So be it, Carthage will overcome this disaster"

 punic_fourth_war: "Fourth Punic War"
 ab_punic.151.t: "Tension Rising"
 ab_punic.151.d: "The growing strength of Carthage is undeniable. Our victories, expansion, and the centralization of the Punic League have put us in direct competition with Rome once again. The whispers from the Senate grow louder each day, and the fear of our rising power threatens the delicate balance in the Mediterranean. History repeats itself - Roman concerns mirror those of centuries ago when Hannibal first threatened the heart of their empire. We now face the same fateful decision he made: to challenge Rome once more, putting an end to their dominance."
 ab_punic.151.a: "We shall complete what Hannibal cannot finish"

 ab_punic.153.t: "Tension Rising"
 ab_punic.153.d: "Carthage's resurgence has reignited old fears among the Senate and the people. The power we once held over the Mediterranean is slipping, and their growing influence is a direct challenge to Roman supremacy. The lessons of history, written in the blood of the Second Punic War, have not been forgotten. The time has come once more to settle the score, as Hannibal's legacy hangs heavy in the air. The Fourth Punic War is inevitable, and we must now prepare to crush Carthage before it grows too powerful."
 ab_punic.153.a: "We will crush them again"

 ab_punic.154.t: "The Fourth Punic War"
 ab_punic.154.d: "The time for peace has passed. The Roman legions march once more, their banners flying high as the drums of war echo across the Mediterranean. The shadow of the past looms large as Carthage braces for yet another struggle against its ancient nemesis. This is no longer a war of survival but a battle for dominance, to decide who will rule the waves and lands of the known world. Hannibal's spirit guides us as we prepare to meet Rome on the field of battle. The Fourth Punic War has begun."
 ab_punic.154.a: "We will end their ambition once and for all!"

 ab_punic.155.t: "The Fourth Punic War"
 ab_punic.155.d: "The Senate has spoken, and the legions march once again. The time has come to put an end to the Punic threat once and for all. Carthage's defiance and ambition have gone unchecked for too long, and history demands a reckoning. This war is not just a campaign; it is a struggle for the supremacy of Rome and the eradication of an old rival. With the might of our legions, we shall bring Carthage to its knees. The Fourth Punic War has begun, and Rome will emerge victorious."
 ab_punic.155.a: "We will end their ambition once and for all!"

 ab_punic.156.t: "New Era of Dominance"
 ab_punic.156.d: "The war is over, and victory is ours. The foe that once stood defiant has been crushed, their dreams of supremacy shattered. This triumph marks the dawn of a new era, where our strength and resolve have solidified our place as the preeminent power of the world. The cost was great, but the rewards are greater. Our banners fly high, a symbol of unyielding dominance. The world will remember this day, for it was not just a victory: it was destiny fulfilled."
 ab_punic.156.a: "Glorious victory!"

 ab_punic.157.t: "Ashes of Defeat"
 ab_punic.157.d: "The fires of war have burned away the foundations of our power, leaving us humbled and broken. Our ambitions lie in ruins, trampled under the weight of the enemy's might. This defeat marks a dark chapter in our history, a bitter reminder of the price of failure. Yet, even in the ashes, embers of hope may still smolder. We must endure, rebuild, and rise again, for the spirit of our people cannot be extinguished. The struggle continues, even in the face of this crushing loss."
 ab_punic.157.a: "This cannot be happening..."

 ab_punic.158.t: "Call to Arms"
 ab_punic.158.d: "The drums of war echo across the land as every able hand is called upon to defend our cause. Soldiers are trained, fortifications strengthened, and reserves rallied to the banner. This is no ordinary conflict - it is a war for supremacy, and every resource must be mobilized for the struggle ahead. The sight of marching legions and the clang of blacksmiths' hammers forge a singular purpose: victory at all costs. The time has come to prepare, for history will not wait for the unready."
 ab_punic.158.a: "All civilians shall be enlisted"

 ab_punic.159.t: "Economic Disruptions"
 ab_punic.159.d: "The shadow of war has cast a pall over our economy, disrupting trade routes and shaking the confidence of merchants. Ports once bustling with commerce now brim with warships, and caravans carry supplies instead of goods. As inflation rises and prosperity wanes, the weight of preparation grows heavier on our people. The path to war is paved not only with steel but with sacrifices that test the resilience of our nation. We must find a way to sustain ourselves or risk faltering before the true conflict even begins."
 ab_punic.159.a: "The war must be ended as soon as possible"

 ab_punic.160.t: "Invasion Fleet"
 ab_punic.160.d: "The construction of a vast fleet dominates our harbors as warships and transports are readied to carry our armies across the Atlantic. This endeavor is a monumental feat of engineering and logistics, requiring vast resources and unyielding dedication. The seas will be our battlefield, and our success depends on the strength of this armada. Whether to conquer or to defend, this fleet is the embodiment of our ambitions. Soon, its sails will cast shadows over distant shores, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in history."
 ab_punic.160.a: "Naval superiority is crucial"

 ab_punic.161.t: "Return of Hannibal"
 ab_punic.161.d: "Whispers echo through the streets and barracks of Carthage: the spirit of Hannibal Barca has returned to lead the nation once more. Though it may be a new general bearing his name or merely invoking his legacy, the effect is undeniable. Carthaginian troops march with renewed vigor, and the Roman legions tremble at the thought of facing such a force. The tales of Hannibal's triumphs are retold, and his specter looms large over the battlefield. Whether legend or reality, this resurgence of Hannibal's legacy is a rallying cry for all Carthaginians to rise against Rome once more."
 ab_punic.161.a: "Embrace the story"
 ab_punic.161.b: "Reject the myth"

 ab_punic.162.t: "Senate Divided"
 ab_punic.162.d: "The Roman Senate is in turmoil. The shadow of Carthage looms large, and the question of how to respond has fractured unity among the Senators. One faction, scarred by memories of past defeats, urges caution, advocating for a defensive war to preserve Roman strength. The other faction, emboldened by dreams of glory, demands an immediate offensive to crush Carthage once and for all. As voices rise and tempers flare, Rome's decision hangs in the balance. The path chosen here will determine whether us stands triumphant or falters under the weight of indecision."
 ab_punic.162.a: "Appeal to the conservative Senators"
 ab_punic.162.b: "Support the warhawks"

 ab_punic.163.t: "Saoshyant of Buniq"
 ab_punic.163.d: "In the twilight of exile and the embers of memory, the Buhutan people stood at a crossroads - no longer vassals of the distant Punic League, yet not yet masters of their own fate. In the sacred groves of Al-Iruqu, the flames of divine purpose were rekindled. There, among whispered prayers and ancient rites, a prophet rose: Saoshyant of Buniq, the Lightbringer, herald of a new age. Under the guidance of Ahura Mazda, yet tempered by the wisdom of the forest and the struggles of their ancestors, the Buhutan were reborn. From this moment forward, they would be known as the Cherokee—Guardians of Light, defenders of the free, and torchbearers of the eternal flame."
 ab_punic.163.a: "Let the world remember this day"

 ab_punic.164.t: "A New Promised Land"
 ab_punic.164.d: "In the mist-laden marshes of the southern lands, where ancient Yamasee traditions echo through pine and cypress, a new dawn breaks. From the union of Punic statecraft and Muskogean spirit, a nation is forged - not by conquest, but by vision. They call it Chisca. Here, tribal wisdom walks hand-in-hand with foreign enlightenment, and temples rise beside council fires. It is a land born not of empire, but of purpose: a sanctuary where heritage is preserved, and faith renewed. This is the New Promised Land. From its waters shall rise a people bound not by blood alone, but by destiny."
 ab_punic.164.a: "Chisca shall rise, and the marshes shall remember our name"

 ab_punic.165.t: "Revival of the Immortals"
 ab_punic.165.d: "In the days of Cyrus and Darius, the Immortals marched not merely as warriors, but as vessels of divine order — ten thousand chosen to uphold Asha against the chaos of the world. When the flames of Zoroaster burned bright, they stood beside it. When it dimmed, they vanished into history.\n\nBut now, the fire is rekindled. Through faith, discipline, and sacred oath, we restore the ranks once believed lost. These are not soldiers — they are the Flame reborn, a living bulwark of righteousness to shield the Faithful and scatter the Lie.\n\nLet the world remember: Zoroaster does not forget. And the Immortals do not die."
 ab_punic.165.a: "By fire and steel, we summon them back into the world!"

 ab_hylinia.11.d: "The Agunqa region has long served as the gateway for the lucrative fur trade, its hunters producing some of the finest pelts in Buniq. Controlling this trade is not merely an economic endeavor: it is a matter of prestige, influence, and survival.\n\nThe Hylinian League and the Order of Zoroaster, each seeking to command the flow of furs from the Agunqa wilderness to the markets of the world, have clashed in yet another Mithraic War. Who will emerge as the master of this prized middleman position, and who will be left to lament their loss in the bitter chill of winter?"
 ab_hylinia.11.a: "Victory is calling for us!"

 ab_hylinia.12.t: "The Fur Trader"
 ab_hylinia.12.d: "The trade routes of Agunqa are now ours to command, granting us control over one of the most coveted positions in the fur trade. The finest pelts, hunted in the frostbitten forests of the Agunqa region, now pass through our hands before reaching the markets of the known world.\n\nThis victory not only strengthens our coffers but elevates our stature among both allies and rivals. As traders from all directions seek access to Agunqa's bounty, our name will echo as the arbiters of wealth and the stewards of commerce in the fur trade."

 ab_hylinia.14.d: "The arrival of the Palemen from across the seas has sent shockwaves through Buniq, heralding an age of uncertainty and peril. As their ships cast ominous shadows upon the shores, the people of Buniq cry out for a protector.\n\nThe Hylinian League and the Order of Zoroaster, rivals through decades of Mithraic Wars, now clash in a final, decisive battle.

This is a momentous decision, one that will reshape the political landscape of the continent for generations to come.\n\nAs one power ascends to the position of leadership, the other must concede its ambitions, for the time of rivalry is over. The age of Buniq's unification begins, and with it, a new guardian to stand against the encroaching shadows from across the sea."
 ab_hylinia.16.a: "The politics of Buniq is changed forever..."

 ab_hylinia.17.t: "The League Collapsed"
 ab_hylinia.17.d: "What was once a shining beacon of unity and cooperation among the Hellenic republics of the north has now fallen into ruin. The Hylinian League, forged in the fires of the Norse-Greek alliance, is no more. Its member states, once bound by shared ideals and mutual defense, have been conquered and scattered. With no central authority to lead them, the legacy of the Hylinians fades into obscurity, a dream lost to the annals of history. The echoes of their glory may yet inspire others, but for now, the League is no more."
 ab_hylinia.17.a: "A tragic end to a noble union"

 ab_hylinia.18.t: "The Order Dismantled"
 ab_hylinia.18.d: "The Order of Zoroaster, once a powerful coalition of Iroquoian tribes united under the radiant banner of the Ahura Mazda, has been utterly dismantled. Its lands lie in the hands of foreign powers, and its sacred fire extinguished. The intricate balance of faith, governance, and military prowess that sustained the Order for so long has been irreparably shattered. With no successor to champion their cause, the Zoroastrian ideals in Buniq face a bleak future. A civilization that sought to light the path of wisdom and righteousness now recedes into shadow."
 ab_hylinia.18.a: "The flame of Ahura Mazda has been extinguished"
