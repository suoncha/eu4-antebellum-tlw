 ab_byzantium.47.t:0 "Belisarius"
 ab_byzantium.47.d:0 "Belisarius, a formidable commander of the Byzantine Empire during Justinian's reign, played a crucial role in reclaiming lost Mediterranean territories from the Western Empire. Despite resource constraints, he earned the esteemed title 'Last of the Romans' for his remarkable victories. Conquering the Vandals in nine months and securing much of Italy during the Gothic War, including the recapture of Rome, he defied overwhelming odds. Now, with our invincible army poised for further conquests, a standout general is required to lead them. Among our Strategos Office ranks, one individual stands out. Despite humble origins, his exceptional talents have propelled him to greatness, earning him comparisons to the legendary Belisarius. He is the natural choice to inherit the mantle of leadership."

 ab_byzantium.48.d:0 "The once formidable Roman Army, renowned across the world, has seen its glory fade in the wake of devastating wars and military failures. As our adversaries advance, we find ourselves diminished, unable to rely solely on past achievements. It's imperative that we adapt to the evolving battlefield. Our first step is the re-militarization of our citizenry, forging them into a formidable force capable of defending our empire."

 ab_byzantium.49.t:0 "Hellenization of the Bulgars"
 ab_byzantium.49.d:0 "For centuries, the Bulgars have been a relentless adversary, their constant warfare contributing to our empire's decline and suffering. Yet, fate has shifted in our favor, granting us dominion over their lands. Now, as masters of their territory, we must act decisively. We shall drive them back to the Volga, expelling their menace from our borders. Those who choose to remain shall be assimilated, embracing the rich culture of Roman Thracia, restoring its ancient glory."
 ab_byzantium.49.a:0 "Only we hold the rightful claim as the sovereigns of the Balkans."
 ab_byzantium.50.t:0 "Hellenization of the Balkans"
 ab_byzantium.50.d:0 "During the era of Justinian, the Balkans were inhabited by Romanized and Hellenized Illyrian people, producing great figures such as Aurelian, Constantine, Valentinianus, and even Justinian himself. However, the devastating Plague ravaged the population, leaving it sparse. With the subsequent migration of the Slavs, the region experienced a resurgence in population and vitality.\n\nOver the years, the Slavic people of the Balkans have attempted to embrace aspects of our Roman way of life. Now, with the recent reconquest of the Balkans, it is time to restore this region to its former glory. Let us integrate the locals and impart upon them the virtues of Roman civilization."

 ab_byzantium.59.t:0 "Diocese System"
 ab_byzantium.59.d:0 "The Diocese, a distinctive subject type within the Roman Empire and the Roman Republic, embodies a regional governance district led by elected Vicariuses. Their primary function is the governance of the land they oversee, affording them a semblance of autonomy within the broader empire. This unique status grants them several special features:\n- They have access to §GRomanization§! mechanic\n- Developing their provinces changes Influence of your §YCultural Spheres§!. But they can't develop themselves\n- They don't take your diplomatic slot, only count their own relative power for liberty desire\n- They won't join your wars automatically.

 ab_byzantium.59.a:0 "Understood"
 ab_byzantium.60.t:0 "Conqueror of the Seven Seas"
 ab_byzantium.60.d:0 "In the annals of Roman history, there exists a tale as audacious as it is absurd. In the first century, Emperor Caligula, driven by his insatiable thirst for conquest, embarked on a campaign to Britain. Yet, the fates conspired against him, for the journey barely reached the shores of Gaul before it was unceremoniously halted.\n\nBut returning to Rome without the laurels of victory was inconceivable for Caligula. In a fit of madness, he declared war not on mortal foes, but on Neptune himself, god of the sea. With hubris unmatched, he commanded his legions to whip the waves into submission. Seashells, humble treasures of the shore, were hailed as spoils of this bizarre conflict.\n\nThough history may mock his folly, the legacy of Caligula's expedition endures. For in the realm of myth and legend, Rome stands unchallenged. Even the vast expanse of the Seven Seas was not beyond the reach of Roman ambition, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Eternal City."

 ab_byzantium.61.t:0 "Punics in the New World"
 ab_byzantium.61.d:0 "This is astonishing!\n\nAs our brave explorers set foot on the shores of the distant land across the vast Atlantic Ocean, they were met with a sight unlike anything they had ever imagined. Bustling ports teeming with people from diverse cultures and religions, rivaling even our most prosperous cities. Initially, there was a fleeting thought that perhaps our preconceived notions of barbarism were mistaken, but the truth soon emerged - the Punics.\n\nIn an incredible twist of fate, it was revealed that the cunning Hannibal had sought refuge on this distant continent during Antiquity, bringing with him thousands of Punics right under our noses.\n\nYet, these Punics have not forgotten their ancient rivalry with us, the Romans. Unfortunately, the revelation of our identity as Romans during a local market trade proved to be a grave mistake for some of our explorers. Some were captured, while others managed to evade capture and return with this shocking news."
 ab_byzantium.61.a:0 "Shall they seek another Punic War? Then so shall they have it!"
 ab_byzantium.62.t:0 "Unification of the Orthodox World"
 ab_byzantium.62.d:0 "The Russian people have long suffered under the yoke of the Tatars and internal strife, while we, bound by circumstance, could offer little aid. Now, with the healing of the Schism, many bishops in their lands have opted to break away, proclaiming their own Autocephaly and independence from the Patriarch in Constantinople. The path is now clear for us to stand as the First, Second, and Third Rome united. Let us not squander this historic moment. Rejoice, Mother Rus, for your sons and daughters shall join the ranks of Roman citizens!"

 ab_byzantium.63.t:0 "Belgica's Identity"
 ab_byzantium.63.d:0 "Behold the challenge of Belgica: a land conquered, yet in the throes of an identity crisis. Historically linked with Gallia in the annals of antiquity, its cultural tapestry weaves a different tale. The local Dutch populace, closer in kinship to their German neighbors than the French, complicates matters further. As we contemplate integration into an adjacent Diocese, the question looms large: to which cultural sphere shall Belgica belong? The answer remains elusive, shrouded in the fog of history and the nuances of identity."

Despite facing threats from all directions, our resilience has prevailed. We have not only defended our borders but reclaimed lands thought lost forever.\n\nToday marks a historic triumph as the Roman people extend their dominion over all of Europe. This achievement surpasses the wildest dreams of our ancestors. Citizens of Rome, celebrate! The Light of Rome shines brighter than ever before, and no barbarian force can extinguish it!"

 ab_byzantium.65.d:0 "After a century under Roman dominion, the cultural landscape of Rus has undergone profound transformation. Initially, it was the East Slavic nobility who embraced Roman alphabets, language, and traditions, a trend that gradually permeated through all strata of society over time. Presently, the majority of [UKR.GetName]'s populace converses in an East Slavic variant of Roman, forsaking their native tongue. Moreover, a notable shift in identity is observed as they reject the labels of Russian or Ruthenian, opting instead for the designation of Ruthenicus."

When the heathens first swept into Visigothic lands, many attempts at resistance were futile. Yet, from the courage of Pelagius and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias arose. Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria, expanded the realm to encompass both Galicia and Asturias, but dynastic disputes later divided them. Navarra's bid for independence, led by Inigo Arista, saw success against Carolingian invaders and Muslim overlords, leading to the rise of the Jimenez Dynasty.\n\nIn 1443, Iberia suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles fell, and northern lands were scorched by Christian raiding parties. A hasty peace between the Franks and Umayyads only temporarily halted the threat of famine and renewed offensive. Yet, for the Iberian crusaders, this peace felt like betrayal, shaking their faith and casting uncertainty on the future."

This status quo has persisted for years, but it hasn't deterred Japan from seeking a solution to break free from it.
