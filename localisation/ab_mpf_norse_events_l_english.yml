ab_mpf_norse.1.t: "Raising A New Runestone"
ab_mpf_norse.1.d: "Our forefathers knew well the importance of remembering those who came before us and what they accomplished, carving their deeds into massive raised stones, called runestones. Although the practice has declined in favour of paper records, we still use them to honour truly momentous individuals and events.\n\n The [Root.GetClergyName] have determined that now is a fine time for the government to erect a new runestone; the only question is, what should it be in honour of?"

ab_mpf_norse.2.t: "A-Viking We Will Go"
ab_mpf_norse.2.d: "Our people have a long history of wanderlust, roving up and down the wild oceans and great rivers, in search of glory, gold, and adventure. As a new generation comes of age, perhaps we should take the opportunity to direct their efforts in a way that will benefit the state."

ab_mpf_norse.3.d: "There is no better way to honour the gods than with a blót, or blood-sacrifice. Every nine years, the grand blót is held: nine days of feasting, drinking, celebration, and of course, sacrifice. To properly prepare, the [Root.GetClergyName] need to know what form this year's sacrifice will take."
