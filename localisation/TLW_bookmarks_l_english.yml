 the_lost_world05_desc: "With the Roman Empire now relegated to the annals of history, numerous empires vie for the title of its rightful successor. Among them, the Byzantines firmly assert their claim as the sole heirs to the ancient legacy. Yet, despite their resilience against crises that threatened to breach the Theodosian Walls, the Angelid dynasty's reign is marred by incompetence and neglect, leaving Constantinople in disarray mere decades after the Humiliation of Thessalonica. As foreign powers circle like vultures, ready to seize what remains, the question looms: Can the empire defy the odds and rise once more, like a phoenix from the ashes?"

 LANDING_updated_the_lost_world05_FLAVOR_TEXT: "With the once-mighty Roman Empire relegated to distant memory, various contenders vie for the mantle of its true successor. Among them, the Byzantines firmly assert their exclusive claim to the ancient legacy. However, despite facing crises that threatened to breach the Theodosian Walls, the Angelid dynasty's rule is marked by incompetence and neglect, culminating in the severing of Anatolian provinces under Leon Gabras. With the Imperial Army disbanded for financial gain and a mercenary force that wreaks havoc instead of providing protection, the empire's influence wanes further. Venice's incursion into the Aegean, aided by Epirote rebellion, exacerbates Constantinople's plight. A futile attempt to assert dominance over the Bulgar Empire in the 15th century proves catastrophic, resulting in the loss of vital territories. With Constantinople in ruins and foreign powers poised for conquest, the question arises: Can the empire defy its imminent demise and rise once more, like a phoenix from the ashes?"

# Heirs of Alexander #

 the_lost_world06_desc: "Leon Gabras, born in 1235, rose through military ranks, earning fame for his victories. Despite his success, the jealous Angelid court exiled him to Anatolia. In 1267, Leon repelled a Turkish incursion but was charged with treason. Disillusioned, he led a mutiny in 1269, declaring Nicaea independent and becoming its king. Inspired by Sultan Nizzar of Egypt, he established a hereditary stratocracy. By 1444, Nicaea was strong and defensive. With Byzantium weakening and the Seljuk Turks regrouping, Nicaea faced a pivotal moment. The Hour of Fate was approaching, and the future of empires was at stake."

 LANDING_updated_the_lost_world06_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Fleeing Turkish encroachment in the 11th and 12th centuries, the aristocratic Gabras family settled in Byzantine Macedonia. Leon Gabras, born in 1235, aspired to be a soldier and quickly rose through the ranks, earning renown for his victories against the Empire's enemies. His greatest achievement came in 1261 when he rallied forces at Pella and defeated the invading Bulgarian army, earning the title Soter, or Savior. Despite this, the jealous Angelid court exiled him to Anatolia. In 1267, Leon repelled another Turkish incursion but was charged with treason by the court. Disillusioned, he led a mutiny in 1269, declaring Nicaea independent. Supported by military governors, he became King of Asia Minor and Exarch of Nicaea, forming a hereditary stratocracy inspired by Nizzar the Great, Sultan of Egypt. By 1444, Nicaea stood as a strong, defensive state. With the Byzantine Empire weakening and the Seljuk Turks regrouping, Nicaea faced a crucial moment. The Hour of Fate was approaching, and the future of empires hung in the balance."

Hannibal Barca, a towering figure of resilience, charted a course westward, away from Rome's grasp, in a bid to secure a brighter future for his people. Under Hannibal's masterful leadership, Carthage defied all odds, settling in uncharted lands across the sea. Generations later, they flourished as an economic powerhouse through trade and collaboration with indigenous tribes. However, looming threats now threaten their hard-won peace. With Hannibal absent, Carthage's fate hangs in the balance. Will they crumble once more, or rise united to reclaim their former glory?"

 LANDING_updated_the_lost_world07_FLAVOR_TEXT: "In the aftermath of the Second Punic War, Carthage teetered on the brink of collapse. Seeking refuge from the rapacious grip of Rome, the legendary Hannibal Barca boldly led an expedition westward into uncharted territories. Under his sagacious leadership, Carthage defied all odds, establishing a new foothold on the distant continent. Centuries passed, this new continent have witnessed the rise of Carthaginian dominance through astute trade and harmonious cohabitation with indigenous peoples. Yet, as new threats loom ominously from across the sea, the absence of Hannibal's guiding hand leaves Carthage facing a crossroads. Will they succumb once more to the tide of history, or will they rise united to reclaim their ancestral legacy?"
