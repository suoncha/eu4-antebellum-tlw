 the_lost_world_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Second Punic War, Carthage was doomed to fall. To secure a better future for the Punic people, the great Hannibal Barca led an expedition to the unknown west, far away from the greedy hands of the Romans. With the brilliant guidance of Hannibal, Carthage's children have accomplished the impossible and found a place to settle on the new continent. Many generations have passed. The Punics have become an economic hegemon in the new world by trading and coexisting with natives. But that peace may come to an end as the new threats re-emerge from over the sea. Without Hannibal to guide them this time, is it their destiny to fall again? Or would they resurge as a united Carthage and reclaim what was theirs long ago?"
