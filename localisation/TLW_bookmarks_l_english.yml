To secure a better future for the Punic people, the great Hannibal Barca led an expedition to the unknown west, far away from the greedy hands of the Romans. With the brilliant guidance of Hannibal, Carthage's children have accomplished the impossible and found a place to settle on the new continent. Many generations have passed. The Punics have become an economic hegemon in the new world by trading and coexisting with natives. But that peace may come to an end as the new threats re-emerge from over the sea. Without Hannibal to guide them this time, is it their destiny to fall again? Or would they resurge as a united Carthage and reclaim what was theirs long ago? §R(THE NEW WORLD IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)§!"

 the_lost_world05:0 "The Lost World | Legacy of Rome"
 the_lost_world05_desc:0 "With the Roman Empire now a distant memory, countless Empires have dared to take the mantle as the true successors to Rome, but the Byzantines remain adamant that they hold the only legitimate claim to that ancient Empire. Despite facing a crisis which may have seen them hanged from the Theodosian Walls, the Angelid dynasty nonetheless proved themselves utterly incapable of anything short of malicious negligence and gross mismanagement of the Eastern Roman Empire. Mere decades have passed since the Humiliation of Thessalonica, and Constantinople is in shambles. Foreign powers now prepare to swoop in and carve up what little remains. In the face of total annihilation, can the Empire pull off a miracle, and ascend once more as a Phoenix from the ashes?"

 LANDING_updated_the_lost_world05_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "With the Roman Empire now a distant memory, countless Empires have dared to take the mantle as the true successors to Rome, but the Byzantines remain adamant that they hold the only legitimate claim to that ancient Empire. Despite facing a crisis which may have seen them hanged from the Theodosian Walls, the Angelid dynasty nonetheless proved themselves utterly incapable of anything short of malicious negligence and gross mismanagement of the Eastern Roman Empire. Even against the threat of Bulgarian invasion in the 13th century, the imperial regime did nothing in response. Yet, when Leon Gabras took up arms and saved the empire, he was hastily banished to a governorship in Anatolia. With an impending Turkish invasion, it was expected that he would perish, no longer posing a threat to the machinations of the political elite. This assumption proved false, and the Saviour of Thrace declared unilateral independence from Constantinople and from the Empire, having concluded that the Roman dream was long dead.\n\nThe Imperial court was utterly livid at the secession of the Anatolian provinces, but even if they wanted to launch a war of reclamation, this was impossible; in order to skim more money off the budget, the chancellor had disbanded the Imperial Army in AD 1294. In its place, a truly unreliable mercenary force was instituted.This warband preferred plundering Byzantine lands to protecting them, however, greatly reducing imperial rule in the countryside. Left with no army of its own and a plummeting economic situation, the Byzantine Empire would then be forced to mothball its fleet, culminating in Venice seeping into the Aegean in the 1300s with the help of an Epirote rebellion under the disgruntled Palaiologos family.\n\nThe complete failure of the government in Constantinople to maintain even a shred of legitimacy and influence would end in one of the worst military blunders in Roman history. At the dawn of the 15th Century, the empire would attempt to assert its hegemony over the Bulgar Empire, despite lacking a proper military, resulting in the rapid loss of Macedonia and Western Thrace to a miniscule Bulgarian detachment. Mere decades have passed since the Humiliation of Thessalonica, and Constantinople is in shambles; the city's population numbers at a meagre 20,000 and is in total disrepair. The severed the land connection from Attica to the capital has crippled domestic commerce, and foreign powers now prepare to swoop in and carve up what little remains. In the face of total annihilation, can the Empire pull off a miracle, and ascend once more as a Phoenix from the ashes?"
